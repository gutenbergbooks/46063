<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>In this new edition of "The Classic Myths in English Literature"
the former order of materials has been altered in accordance
with the advice of the teachers who have had longest experience
with the use of the book; the old material has been thoroughly
revised; and much new material has been added. Since most
people prefer to begin a story at its beginning, and not with the
career of its author and his genealogy, I have reserved the history
of the myths for the conclusion of the text. Some of the myths
have been restated in more careful form. Some short narratives,
before omitted, have been included. The sketches of the Iliad
and the Odyssey have been considerably expanded; and an outline&mdash;which,
I hope, will be deemed adequate&mdash;of Wagner's
version of the Ring of the Nibelung has been appended to the
account of Norse and German mythology. That version is, of
course, not English literature; but it has come to be received as
the classic modern version of the story; and the story is needed,
at some time or other, by every lover of music. Fresh examples
of the employment of myth in English verse have, where practicable,
been incorporated in the text; and some new references
will be found in the Commentary.</p>

<p>I have thoroughly revised the list of illustrative cuts, have interpreted
the more difficult of the ancient figures, and indicated
the sources. The pictures themselves are a decided improvement
upon those in the former edition. In the determination of sources
for reproduction, I have had the valuable assistance of Dr. E. von
Mach, the author of more than one well-known work on ancient
art; and to him I am indebted, in addition, for the section on The
Classic Myths in Art, which is included in my Introduction. With
this new equipment the book should prove more useful to those
who here make their first acquaintance with art, especially the art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
of the ancients, as well as to those who have been in the habit
of using it as a guide to paintings and sculptures of mythological
subjects in foreign galleries.</p>

<p>Much of our best English poetry lies beyond the imaginative
reach of many readers because of their unfamiliarity with the
commonplaces of literary allusion, reference, and tradition. Of
such commonplaces few are more frequently recurrent than those
furnished by the literature of myth.</p>

<p>In view of this consideration, the Academic Council of the
University of California, some twenty years ago, introduced into its
requirements for entrance in English the subject of Classical Mythology
in its relation to English Literature, and recommended, as
a textbook for preparation, Bulfinch's "Age of Fable." The experience
of English and classical teachers in the schools of the state
attested the wisdom of the requirement; but the demand for some
textbook adapted to the needs of the classroom made necessary
the preparation of this volume. For while "The Age of Fable"
offered a tempting collection of Greek, Norse, and Oriental narratives,
it was designed neither as a schoolbook nor as a systematized
presentation and interpretation of the myths that have most influenced
English literature.</p>

<p>At the request of my publishers I undertook at that time such a
revision and rearrangement of the materials of "The Age of Fable"
as might adapt it to the purposes of teacher and pupil, and to the
taste of readers somewhat more advanced in years than those addressed
by the original work or by the edition which bore the name
of the Reverend Edward Everett Hale. But after a year's work I
found that half my material for copy was new, and that the
remainder differed in many important respects from the book
upon which it was based. Consequently, while the obligation to
"The Age of Fable" was acknowledged in full, a different title
was selected for the resulting volume. For neither my publishers nor
I desired that the scholarship or the taste of Mr. Bulfinch should
be held accountable for liberties that were taken with his work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<p>In "The Classic Myths in English Literature and in Art," Chapters
XXIII-XXVII, containing sketches of the Fall of Troy, the
Odyssey, the &AElig;neid, and of certain Norse lays, are a revision of
corresponding chapters in "The Age of Fable." Chapters VII-XX,
and XXII, comprising Myths of the Greater Divinities of
Heaven, Earth, the Underworld, and the Waters, Myths of the
Lesser Divinities of the same regions, Myths of the Older Heroes
and Myths of the Younger Heroes, and the outline of the Trojan
War, represent a total rearrangement and recomposition of the
original material, section by section, and frequently paragraph by
paragraph,&mdash;such portions of "The Age of Fable" as have been
retained being abridged or rewritten, and, in places too frequent to
enumerate, supplemented by new and necessary sentences, paragraphs,
and sections. The Introduction, the first six chapters (on
the Greek Myths of the Creation, and the attributes of Greek and
Roman divinities), Chapters XXI and XXVIII-XXXII (on the
Houses concerned in the Trojan War, the Saga of the Volsungs,
the Lay of the Nibelungs, Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung, and on
the origin, elements, distribution, and preservation of myth), the
choice of poetic and artistic illustration, the footnotes referring to
sources, and the Commentary are wholly, or essentially, my own.
In fact, there is little but the scaffolding of "The Age of Fable"
now remaining in the book.</p>

<p>Although in the Index of Mythological Subjects and their Sources
the more common myths of some other nations are briefly stated,
no myths save those known to the Greeks, Romans, Norsemen, or
Germans have been included in the body of the text. The scope of
selection has been thus confined for three reasons: first, the regard
for necessary limits; second, the desirability of emphasizing only
such myths as have actually acclimated themselves in English-speaking
lands and have influenced the spirit, form, and habit of
English imaginative thought; third, the necessity of excluding all
but the unquestionably classic. The term <i>classic</i>, however, is, of
course, not restricted to the products of Greece and Rome; nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
is it employed as synonymous with Classical or as antithetical to
Romantic. From the extreme Classical to the extreme Romantic
is a far cry; but as human life knows no divorce of necessity from
freedom, so genuine art knows neither an unrelieved Classical nor
an unrestrained Romantic. Classical and Romantic are relative
terms. The Classical and the Romantic of one generation may
merit equally to be the classics of the next. Therefore certain
Hellenic myths of romantic spirit or construction have been included
in this work, and certain Norse and German myths have
not been excluded. Whatever is admitted, is admitted as first-class:
first-class, because simple, spontaneous, and beautiful; because fulfilling
the requirements of perennial freshness, of &aelig;sthetic potency,
and of ideal worth.</p>

<p>In the matter of illustrative English and American poems the
principle of selection has been that the verses shall translate a
myth from the classic original, or exemplify the poetic idealization
and embellishment of the subject, or suggest the spirit and mien
of ancient art. But in each case regard has been had to the &aelig;sthetic
value of the poem or the citation. In the search for suitable examples
I have derived valuable assistance from Mr. E.C. Guild's
"Bibliography of Greek Mythology in English Poetry of the Nineteenth
Century" (Bowdoin College, <i>Library Bulletin No. 1</i>). The
student is also referred to A.E. Sawtelle's "Sources of Spenser's
Mythology," C.G. Osgood's' "Classical Mythology of Milton," and
R.K. Root's "Classical Mythology in Shakespeare" (Holt, 1896,
1900, and 1903, respectively).</p>

<p>In the Commentary four things have been attempted: first, an
explanation, under each section, of ordinary textual difficulties;
second, an unpretentious exposition of the myth or a brief statement
of the more evident interpretations advanced by philologists
or ethnologists; third, an indication of certain additional poems
or verses that illustrate the myth; fourth, special mention of such
masterpieces of ancient and modern sculpture and painting as may
serve to introduce the student or the general reader to a field of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
&aelig;sthetic profit neglected by the great mass of our people. For the
poetic conception of most of the myths contained in Chapters
I-XXIV, we are indebted to the Greek imagination; but since
this book is intended for students of English poetry, and since in
English poetry Latin names of mythological characters are much
more frequently employed than Greek, the Latin designations or
Latinized forms of Greek names have been, so far as possible, retained;
and such variations as Jupiter, Jove&mdash;Proserpina, Proserpine,
freely used. In the chapters, however, on the attributes of
the Greek gods, names exclusively Greek have been placed in
parentheses after the usual Roman equivalents, Latin appellations,
or designations common to both Greek and Roman usage. In the
transliteration of Greek names I have followed, also, the prevalent
practice of our poets, which is, generally speaking, the practice of the
Romans. The diphthong &#949;&#953;, for instance, is transliterated according
to the accepted English pronunciation, which in individual words
perpetuates the preference of the Latins for the <i>e</i> sound or the
<i>i</i> sound respectively. So &#x1F08;&tau;&rho;&epsilon;&#x1F77;&delta;&eta;&sigmaf; becomes Atr&#x012B;des; &#7992;&#966;&#953;&#956;&#8051;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#945;,
Iphimed&#x012B;a. But, on the other hand, &#922;&#965;&#952;&#8051;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#945; becomes Cyther&#x0113;a;
&Pi;&eta;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;, Pen&#x0113;us; and &#924;&#8053;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#945;, Med&#x0113;a; while owing to purely popular
English custom, such a name as &#934;&#949;&#953;&#948;&#8055;&#945;&#962; has become, not Pheidias
nor even Ph&#x012B;dias, but&mdash;<i>Ph&#x012D;dias</i>. A few names of islands, towns,
persons, etc., that even in Latin retain their Greek forms,&mdash;such
as Delos, Naxos, Argos, Aglauros, Pandrosos,&mdash;have been transferred
without modification. So also has Poseidon, because that is
the common English spelling. In short, the practice aimed at has
been not that of scientific uniformity, but of acknowledged poetic
usage. In the titles of the illustrative cuts, Greek names have been
used for works of Greek origin, Latin for the Roman.</p>

<p>For the benefit of readers who do not know the fundamental
rules for the pronunciation of Greek and Latin proper names in
English, a brief statement of rules is prefixed to the Index; and
in the Index of Mythological Subjects and their Sources names
are not only accented, but, when necessary, diacritically marked.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a><br />

<span class="ph3">THE STUDY OF MYTHOLOGY IN CONNECTION WITH ENGLISH
POETRY AND WITH ART</span></h2>


<p>Our American educational methods too frequently seek to produce
the effect of polish upon a kind of sandstone information that
will not stand polishing. With such fatuity many of our teachers
in the secondary schools exercise their pupils in the study of English
masterpieces and in the critical estimate of &aelig;sthetic qualities
before acquainting them with the commonplace facts and fables
that, transmitted through generations, are the material of much of
our poetry because the material of daily converse, imagination, and
thought. These commonplaces of tradition are to be found largely
in the literature of mythology. Of course the evil would be neither
so widespread nor so dangerous if more of the guardians and
instructors of our youth were at home even among the Greek and
Latin classics. But for various reasons,&mdash;some valid, as, for instance,
the importance of increased attention to the modern languages
and the natural sciences; others worthless, as the so-called
utilitarian protest against the cultivation of "dead" languages,&mdash;for
various reasons the study of the classics is at present considerably
impaired. It is, therefore, incumbent upon our universities
and schools, recognizing this fact and deploring it, to abate so far
as possible the unfortunate consequences that proceed therefrom,
until, by a readjustment of subjects of instruction and of the periods
allotted them, the Greek and Latin classics shall be reinstated in
their proper place as a means of discipline, a humanizing influence,
the historic background against which our present appears. For,
cut off from the intellectual and imaginative sources of Greece and
Rome, the state and statesmanship, legislation and law, society
and manners, philosophy, religion, literature, art, and even artistic
appreciation, run readily shallow and soon dry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, one evident means of tempering the consequence of this
neglect of the classics is the study of them through translations
and summaries. Such secondhand study must indeed be ever a
makeshift; for the literature of a people inheres in its language,
and loses its seeming and often its characteristic when caparisoned
in the trappings of another speech,&mdash;an utterance totally
dissimilar, the outcome of diverse conditions of physical environment,
history, social and intellectual tradition. But in dealing with
the purely imaginative products of antiquity, the inefficacy of translation
may be somewhat offset if those products be reproduced, so
far as possible, not in the prosaic but in the poetic atmosphere
and in the imaginative garb of art. For though the phenomena of
plastic art are not the same in one continent as in another, or from
one century to the next, and though the fashion of poetry itself
varies from age to age and from clime to clime, the genesis of
imagination is universal, its products are akin, and its process is
continuous. For this reason the study of the imaginative thought
of the ancients through the artistic creations of the moderns is
commended to students and readers as feasible and profitable.</p>

<p>The study of the classic myths stimulates to creative production,
prepares for the appreciation of poetry and other kinds of
art, and furnishes a clew to the spiritual development of the
race.</p>

<p>1. Classic mythology has been for succeeding poetry, sculpture,
and painting, a treasure house replete with golden tales and glimmering
thoughts, passions in the rough and smooth, and fancies
rich bejeweled. Like Virgil's Shadows that flit by the Lethean
stream until at beck of Fate they revisit upper day and the ever-tranquil
stars, these ghosts of "far-off things and battles long ago,"
peopling the murmurous glades of myth, await the artist who shall
bestow on each his new and predetermined form and restore them,
purified and breathing of Elysian air, to the world of life and ever-young
mankind.</p>

<p>2. For the reader the study of mythology does, in this respect,
as much as for poet, sculptor, or painter. It assists him to thrid the
labyrinth of art, not merely with the clew of tradition, but with a
thread of surer knowledge whose surest strand is sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span></p>

<p>The knowledge of mythic lore has led men in the past broadly
to appreciate the motives and conditions of ancient art and literature,
and the uniform and ordered evolution of the &aelig;sthetic sense.
And, beside enriching us with heirlooms of fiction and pointing
us to the sources of imaginative joy from which early poets of
Hellenic verse, or Norse, or English, drank, the classic myths
quicken the imaginative and emotional faculties to-day, just as of
old. How many a man held by the sorrows of the Labdacid&aelig; or
the love of Alcestis, by some curious wonder in Pausanias, or some
woe in Hyginus, has waked to the consciousness of artistic fancy
and creative force within himself! How many, indifferent to the
well-known round, the trivial task, the nearest care of home, have
read the Farewell to Andromache and lived a new sympathy, an
unselfish thrill, a purified delight! And not only as an impulse
toward artistic output, or patriotic devotion, or domestic altruism,
but as a restraining influence, a chastener of &aelig;sthetic excess, a
moderator of the "unchartered freedom" that knows no mean
between idolatry and loathing, of the foolish frenzy that affects
new things, abnormal and sensational, in literature, music, and the
plastic arts,&mdash;as such a tutor and governor is the study of beautiful
myths invaluable. Long familiarity with the sweet simplicity,
the orderly restraint, the severe regard, the filial awe that pervade
the myths of Greece and Rome,&mdash;or with the newness of life and
fullness and wonder of it, the na&iuml;vet&eacute; and the romance, of Eddic
lore,&mdash;cannot but graciously temper our modern estimate of artistic
worth.</p>

<p>The study, when illustrated by masterpieces of literature and art,
should lead to the appreciation of concrete artistic productions of
both these kinds.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that a rational series of somewhat consecutive
stories is more serviceable to the reader than a congeries of
data acquired by spasmodic consultation of the classical dictionary,&mdash;a
mass of information bolted, as it were, but by no means digested.
If, moreover, these stories are narrated in genealogical and realistic
sequence and are illustrated by lyric, narrative, and descriptive
passages of modern literature, there is furnished not only that
material of allusion and reference for which the student nowadays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
trusts to meager and disjointed textbook notes, but a potentiality
that should render the general reading of <i>belles-lettres</i> more profitable.
For a previous acquaintance with the material of literary
tradition heightens the appreciation of each allusive passage as it
is encountered; it enables the reader to sympathize with the mood
and to enter into the purpose of the poet, the essayist, the novelist,
the orator; it expands the intellectual lungs for the atmosphere
breathed by the artist, at any rate for a literary and social atmosphere
less asthmatic than that to which so many of us are unconsciously
habituated. Of course all this advantage would far better
result from the first-hand nutriment and discipline of the Greek
and Latin classics; of course direct familiarity with the writers of
Greece and Rome is the <i>sine qua non</i> of level-headed criticism and
broad evaluation of modern literature; and, of course, a sympathy
with the imaginings of old is the best incentive to an &aelig;sthetic estimate
not only of art but of nature to-day; but if our American
pupils and many of their teachers cannot quaff Massic and Falernian,
they do well to scent the bouquet. In time a sense of flavor
may perchance be stimulated, and ultimately a desire for nearer
acquaintance with the literatures that we inherit.</p>

<p>The study of these ancient tales serves, then, much more than
the purpose of special information. It refines the &aelig;sthetic judgment
in general, and heightens the enjoyment of such works of
literature as, not treating of mythical or classical subjects, still possess
the characteristics of the classic: the unconscious simplicity,
the inevitable charm, and the noble ideality. The Lycidas, the
Adonais, the Thyrsis, the In Memoriam, the Ode to Duty, the
Bothie of Tober-na-Vuolich, the Hymn of Man, Love is Enough,
Prospice, Festus, the Ode of Life, the Dream of Gerontius, Lying
in the Grass, and Simmenthal must mean little to one devoid of
the spirit of classicism.</p>

<p>In respect of art a similar inspiration, aid, instruction, are afforded
by the study. This volume is liberally supplied with cuts of famous
paintings and sculptures of mythical subjects. Familiarity with
specimens of ancient art, even through the medium of photography
and engraving, must not only cultivate the historic sense but
stimulate the &aelig;sthetic. The cruder efforts of the ancients, no less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
than the more refined, are windows through which we view the
ancient mind. The frequent contemplation of their nobler efforts
and of the modern masterpieces here reproduced may avail to lift
some from the level of apathy or provinciality in matters of imagination;
some it may spur to a study of the originals, some to
artistic creation. A public which, from year to year, displays a
deeper interest in the art of foreign lands will despise no auxiliary
to a more intelligent appreciation of that art. A country whose
future in artistic achievement cannot be prophesied in a paragraph
will more and more truly recognize the value of a study that is an
introduction to much that is best in art as it exists.</p>

<p>3. Furthermore, it must be borne in mind that the myths of the
ancients, as the earliest literary crystallization of social order and
religious fear, record the incipient history of religious ideals and of
moral conduct. For though ethnologists may insist that to search
for truth <i>in</i> mythology is vain, the best of them will grant that to
search for truth <i>through</i> mythology is wise and profitable. If we
accept the statement (often stretched beyond its proper limit) that
mythology is primitive philosophy, and the other statement that an
ancient philosophy never dies, but by process of internal growth,
of modification, and of accretion acquires a purer spirit and a new
and higher form,&mdash;then, since truth was never yet conceived of
error (<i>ex nihilo nihil fit</i>), the truth now recognized, while it did
not exist in that fraction of myth which happens to be irrational,
existed as an archetypal impulse,&mdash;set the myth in motion, and, as
a process refining the mind of man, tended steadily to eliminate
from primitive philosophy (that is, from the myths that embodied
primitive philosophy) the savage, ephemeral, and irrational element.
For all myths spring from the universal and inalienable
desire to know, to enjoy, to teach. These impulses of knowledge,
of imaginative relaxation, of conduct, are the throbbing of the
heart of reason; the first or the second is the primal pulse of every
myth, and to the life of every myth each impulse may be, at some
period, contributory. This study has led men to trace soberly the
progress of their kind from the twilight of gray conjecture to the
dawn of spiritual conviction and rational individuality; to discern a
continuity of thought, an outward reach of imagination, an upward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>
lift of moral and religious ideas; to confess the brotherhood of
humanity and an inspiring purpose which holds good for every
race and through all time.</p>


<h3>SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS</h3>

<p>1. <i>Of the Classic Myths in their Relation to Literature.</i> It is
essential that the teacher of mythology, no matter what textbook
or system he uses or what classic epic he proposes to present,
should first make himself acquainted with the meaning of myth,
its origin and elements; the difference between myth and fable,
between myths explanatory and myths &aelig;sthetic, myths reasonable
and myths unreasonable, the theories of myth-making as a process
of deterioration or as a process of development. He should also
inform himself concerning the ways in which the leading myths
have been disseminated, and how the survivors have been preserved.
Materials for this preparation he will find in Chapters
XXX-XXXII of this book as readily, perhaps, as elsewhere;
but no matter where he obtains this information he should in a
simple and interesting talk pass on the cream of it to the pupils
about to begin the study of the stories themselves. He will in that
way bring them to a reasonable appreciation of the value of myths
and their relation to our civilization, and awaken in them anticipatory
interest in the proposed reading. It is a great mistake to
plunge students of high-school age, without preliminary orientation
and a justification of the study, into a world which may otherwise
appear to them unreasonable in conception and unrelated in
experience. Pupils may, if time permits, read these concluding
chapters, and so obtain a systematic outlook upon the subject,
during a brief review in the senior year, but not earlier.</p>

<p>This book should be studied for its materials and the inspiration
that it affords,&mdash;not word by word for its style, or as a dictionary
or scientific authority; nor paragraph by paragraph with a painful
committing to memory of each myth and each episode in the myth.
Discrimination must be made. Some of these myths, and especially
the episodes from the epics (Chapters XXII-XXIX), are
to be read rapidly and in large assignments, sometimes at home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
with reports in class, sometimes in class and at sight, but always
for the enjoyment. Others are to be studied in detail, but solely
when they are of special and vital significance, historically, morally,
or &aelig;sthetically. Emphasis should be laid only occasionally and
sparingly upon interpretations of mythical materials. What both
teacher and student should aim at is the picture&mdash;manners, morals,
ideals, heroic figures, epic events, broad and vivid against the canvas
of antiquity: that, and the reality of classic order, grandeur,
and restraint.</p>

<p>The myths are here presented in a logical and genealogical
arrangement; and they should be studied in this order, so that the
pupil may carry away, not a jumble of sporadic recollections, but
some conception of the systems of creative imagination which
obtained in earlier civilizations. The knowledge of the myths and
the proper perspective of their relation, one to another, may further
be fixed by the study of the family ties that motivate many
of the incidents of mythical adventure, and that must have been
commonplaces of information to the inventors and narrators of
these stories.</p>

<p>The myths may well be reproduced as exercises in narration,
comparison, description; and they may be regarded as stimulus
for imaginative invention concerning local wonders and beauties
of nature. Pupils may also be encouraged to consider, and to
comment upon, the moral qualities of the heroes and heroines of
mythology. Thus they may be led to recognize the difference
between ancient and modern standards of right and wrong. To
this end, and for the supply of further nutriment, it is important
that teachers collect from their reading of the classic originals, or
from translations of the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Greek dramatists,
the &AElig;neid, the Metamorphoses, etc., material supplementary to
the text, and give it freely to their classes. To facilitate this practice
the sources of the myths have been indicated in the footnotes
of this volume, and a few of the best translations have been mentioned
in the Commentary. Instructors should also read to the
classes illustrative English poems, or portions of them based upon
the myths under consideration; and they should encourage the
pupils to collect from their English reading additional examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>
of the literary survival or adaptation of ancient story. For this purpose
special sections of the Commentary have been prepared, indicating
some of the best known literary applications of each myth.</p>

<p>The Commentary is numbered in sections corresponding to those
of the text. The Textual Notes should be studied in connection
with each lesson, the Interpretative more sparingly, as I have said.
They should not be suffered to spoil the interest in the stories as
such. They are of interest in themselves only to maturer minds.
Allusions and interpretations which the younger pupil does not
appreciate will, if the book is used for purposes of reference in his
further English, Latin, or Greek studies, be clear before the end
of his course.</p>

<p>From the outset care should be taken that pupils give to the
classical names their proper accent, and that they anglicize both
vowels and consonants according to the recognized rules laid down
in the Latin grammars, the English dictionaries, and the pages
preceding the Index of this book.</p>

<p>Mythological and classical geography should not be neglected.
The maps accompanying this volume will be serviceable; but there
should be in the classroom one of Kiepert's maps of the World
as Known to the Ancients (Orbis Veteribus Notus), or maps of
Ancient Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor. The teacher will find the
International Atlas (G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York), A. Keith
Johnston's School and College Atlas of Ancient Geography, or the
new edition of the same by James Cranstoun, issued as Ginn and
Company's Classical Atlas, indispensable in the prosecution of
general reading.</p>

<p>When it is the intention to study, in connection with the book,
an Homeric epic or a portion of it, the teacher should first make
sure that the class has an adequate preliminary training in general
mythology (such, for instance, as may be provided by the first
twenty-one chapters); he should then outline rapidly and entertainingly
the epic as a whole, emphasizing its position in the literature
of the world and its relation to the world of its own times,
before proceeding to read it in detail with the class. Excellent
suggestions as to this method of study are offered in the Introduction
to Maxwell &amp; Chubb's Pope's Homer's Iliad, Books I, VI,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
XXII, and XXIV (Longmans), and in the Introduction to the
Riverside Edition of the Odyssey: Ulysses among the Ph&aelig;acians
(Houghton Mifflin Company).</p>

<p>The more important myths and the best illustrative poems should
provide not only nutriment for thought, but material for memory.
Our youth in the push for hasty achievement bolt their meals; they
masticate little, swallow everything, digest nothing,&mdash;and having
agonized, forget. If fewer things were dispatched, especially in the
study of literature, and if more were intrusted to the memory,
there would be something to assimilate and time to assimilate
it; there would be less dyspepsia and more muscle. Teachers and
parents are over-considerate, nowadays, of the memory in children:
they approach it gingerly; they have feared so much to wring its
withers that in most children the memory has grown too soft for
saddling. In our apprehension lest pupils may turn out parrots, we
have too often turned them out loons. It is better that a few of
the facts in their heads be wrong than that no facts be there at
all. With all our study of children and our gabble about methods
of teaching them, while we insist, properly enough, that youth is
the seedtime of observation, we seem to have forgotten that it is
also the harvest-time of memory. It is easy for children to remember
what they learn, it is a delight for them to commit to memory;
we act criminally when we send them forth with hardly a fact or a
date or a glorious verse in the memory of one out of ten of them.
Such, unfortunately, is the case in many of our schools; and such
was not the case in the day of our fathers. Pupils should be
encouraged to recite <i>memoriter</i> the best poems and verses that
accompany the myths here given; and they should not be allowed
to pass allusions already explained without recalling verses that
contain them.</p>

<p>But above all things should be cultivated, by means of this study,
the spiritual capabilities of our youth. <i>Pabulum</i> for thought, accurate
habits of memory, critical judgment, simplicity and directness
of oral and written expression, may all be furnished or developed by
other educative agencies; but what stimulus to fancy, to poetic sensitiveness
and reflection, to a near kinship with the spirit of nature
humanized, can be found more cogent than the contemplation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>
the poetic traditions that abide in verse? Mythology, fraught with
the fire of imagination, kindles the present from the past.</p>

<p>In this new world of ours, shall slopes and mountains, gorges,
ca&ntilde;ons, flowery fields and forests, rivers, bays, Titanic lakes, and
shoreless reach of ocean be seen of eyes that lack insight, be known
of men for whom nature does not live? Surely the age of myth is
not wholly past; surely the beauties and the wonders of nature are
a fable of things never fully revealed; surely this new republic of
ours, no less than her prototypes by Tyrrhenian and &AElig;gean seas,
utters, in her queenly form and flowing robes, a spirit, a truth, a
potential poetry, and a beauty of art, the grace of which we Americans,
with deeper imaginative training and sympathy and awe, may
yet more highly value and more clearly comprehend.</p>

<p>2. <i>Of the Classic Myths in their Relation to Art.</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The illustration
of a book on ancient mythology offers great difficulties, because
the modern reader expects one thing and the ancient artist, on whose
works one must rely, intentionally offers a very different thing. We
have grown to be a reading people, forming our ideas largely on
the written word, while in antiquity the spoken word opened the
door to understanding. A story which has been committed to writing
is fixed for all time, having lost its power of growth; whereas
a tale that passes from mouth to mouth, with no record by which
to check its accuracy in particulars, is free to expand. It changes
with the moods of those who tell it, and the intellectual and moral
standards of those who listen. People to-day are unimaginative and
literal. They also expect that the pictures which illustrate their
books shall follow the individual conceptions of the author closely.
When the story is dramatized a certain latitude is granted to the
actor; the artist, however, who illustrates the book has no such
freedom. He is expected to take precisely the author's view of a
fictitious character, and, consequently, his individuality may show
itself only in the technique. In antiquity there were no standard
books of fiction or of myths. When writing came into use with the
sixth century before Christ, the individual versions of this or that
great epic poem or drama were preserved; but the great mass of
the people knew them, not because they had read the manuscripts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>but because they had heard them acted or recited. Book illustrations,
therefore, were unknown. Yet so powerful was the impression
which the myths made on the people that most of the artists
drew their inspiration from them. Artists and poets alike wished
to make real the powerful characters of Greek tradition. To make
a literally true illustration of any one version of a great myth was
not the aim of a classic artist.</p>

<p>Another difficulty is found in the fact that few ancient myths
continued to be equally interesting to the people all the time. It is
therefore necessary for us, in choosing illustrations, to draw on all
periods of ancient art, the crude beginning and the decline as well
as the brief span of fine art. The comparatively meager store of
genuinely classic works of art acts as one of the greatest obstacles
to the compilation of a continuous record of classic myths in classic
art. To give such a record, however, rather than to <i>illustrate</i> his
book, must be the aim of the author who publishes to-day a version
of ancient mythology together with such pictures or reliefs or statues
as are preserved. The modern reader of such a book should therefore
appreciate this fact: he must make allowance for the gradual
development of ancient art. The picture is not there for the sake
of strengthening the written work, but for its own sake. It often
offers an independent version of the myth which he reads, and at
all times may give him an insight into the mental make-up of the
classic people.</p>

<p>Sculpture was the finest art of the Greeks, if one may judge by
the remains. In this province the artists worked according to the
best principles of art, making their appeal directly to the nobler
side of man. Before an ancient statue one feels the power of an
idea immediately, and not by the circuitous route of remembering
a sequence of words which may have aimed to suggest a similar
idea. The Greeks were the least literal in their sculpture. Their
marbles, therefore, cannot yield <i>illustrations</i> which the modern
editor can use, except when they embody, like the Demeter of
Knidos (Fig. 29) or the Athena of Velletri (Fig. 10), a well-defined
character-conception. The modern reader, on the other hand, cannot
fail to notice that this conception never does justice to the
character of the goddess as it appears in all the myths, and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
rarely even to that characteristic which may dominate the particular
version of any one myth. If such pictures, however, were entirely
omitted from the book, the best means of appreciating the essential
nobility of the Greek mind would be lost.</p>

<p>None of the Greek masterpieces of painting are extant. Their
attenuated influence, however, may be traced in the Italian wall
paintings from Pompeii and elsewhere. Painting permits greater
literalness than sculpture. The picture from Herculaneum, for
instance,&mdash;Io, Argus, and Mercury (Fig. 47),&mdash;tells a definite
story and one which is also told by the poets. But the painter
has considered the making of a pleasing picture first, and given
only a secondary thought to accuracy of tradition. This must be
so; for while we may without displeasure listen to the description
of a monster, we cannot see his actual representation without
discomfort. When we hear how the companions of Ulysses were
turned into swine, the tragic note is never lost. To paint this scene,
however, and not to border on the ridiculous or the burlesque is
given only to the greatest artist&mdash;if it is at all possible.</p>

<p>Fortunately for our purposes of illustration, there was a class of
secondary artists in Greece which did not always shrink from selecting
subjects ill adapted for art, and from rendering them with
slight variations so that they are neither bad to look at nor altogether
untrue. These were the painters of vases. Some of them were
masters of their craft (cf. Fig. 116), others were of only mediocre
skill. All, however, like their nobler brethren, were primarily concerned
with the decorative and technical side of their art and but
secondarily with their subject. If the story, for instance, called for
four persons and their space for five, they unhesitatingly added the
fifth person, and, vice versa, removed one without compunction if
they had place for fewer figures than the story demanded. Being,
moreover, commercial people, they painted according to fashion.
Whatever version of a myth happened to be popular, that they
selected, so that it has been possible to trace by their vases the
changes which several myths underwent from the sixth century
onward.</p>

<p>A careful student notices the similarity of types in many of these
pictures and realizes that the ancient painter of vases started out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
with a certain stock-in-trade which he altered as little as possible,
adding something new only where it was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>From these observations it is clear that the works of men who
were least gifted artistically are the best adapted for the purposes
of book illustrations; for a painter is literal in the inverse ratio of
his worth as artist. Nothing, therefore, could be less fair than to
judge Greek vase painting by the collection of pictures here offered.
Only paintings like Figures 85 and 101, for instance, can give a
hint of the best that these men produced.</p>

<p>Going gradually down the scale of artists one finally comes to
the level of the makers of Roman sarcophagi, in whose honor it can
only be said that to descend lower is impossible. Several myths,
however,&mdash;the story of the fall of Pha&euml;thon (Fig. 59), for instance,&mdash;are
not illustrated in art before the decadent period of imperial
Roman sculpture. It is therefore necessary to draw also upon this
source.</p>

<p>Of course unity of art or school or excellence cannot be preserved
in a set of pictures which groups the Demeter of Knidos
(Fig. 29), the blinding of Polyphemus (Fig. 171), and the fall of
Pha&euml;thon (Fig. 59). But individually the pictures help to fix in
memory the particular stories that they are chosen to illustrate;
and collectively they show how strongly the myths here retold influenced
the noblest fancy of the great artists as well as the receptive
minds of mediocre artisans. The suggestive power of classic
myths, moreover, was not confined to antiquity. When learning and
culture returned to the world in the Renaissance, this power also
returned. Raphael (see Fig. 12) and Michelangelo (see Fig. 183)
were under its sway, and so are many modern artists (see Figs. 72
and 154). They did not all understand the classic spirit equally,
therefore some of their pictures are modern in everything save the
title, while others have caught the truth with singular accuracy and
are modern only in technique. Adding these Italian and more recent
pictures to the collection further destroys mere unity, but it insures,
on the other hand, a full appreciation of the abiding and ennobling
power of ancient mythology.</p>

<span class="ph4">GREEK MYTHS OF THE CREATION</span></h3>


<p><b>1. Purpose of the Study.</b> Interwoven with the fabric of our
English literature, of our epics, dramas, lyrics, and novels, of our
essays and orations, like a golden warp where the woof is only too
often of silver, are the myths of certain ancient nations. It is the
purpose of this work to relate some of these myths, and to illustrate
the uses to which they have been put in English literature,
and, incidentally, in art.</p>

<p><b>2. The Fable and the Myth.</b> Careful discrimination must be
made between the fable and the myth. A fable is a story, like that
of King Log, or the Fox and the Grapes, in which characters and
plot, neither pretending to reality nor demanding credence, are
fabricated confessedly as the vehicle of moral or didactic instruction.
Dr. Johnson narrows still further the scope of the fable:
"It seems to be, in its genuine state, a narrative in which <i>beings</i>
<i>irrational, and sometimes inanimate</i>, are, for the purpose of moral
instruction, feigned to act and speak with human interests and
passions." Myths, on the other hand, are stories of anonymous
origin, prevalent among primitive peoples and by them accepted
as true, concerning supernatural beings and events, or natural
beings and events influenced by supernatural agencies. Fables are
made by individuals; they may be told in any stage of a nation's
history,&mdash;by a Jotham when the Israelites were still under the
Judges, 1200 years before Christ, or by Christ himself in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
days of the most critical Jewish scholarship; by a Menenius
when Rome was still involved in petty squabbles of plebeians and
patricians, or by Ph&aelig;drus and Horace in the Augustan age of
Roman imperialism and Roman letters; by an &AElig;sop, well-nigh
fabulous, to fabled fellow-slaves and Athenian tyrants, or by La
Fontaine to the Grand Monarch and the most highly civilized
race of seventeenth-century Europe.</p>

<p>Fables are vessels made to order into which a lesson may be
poured. Myths are born, not made. They are born in the infancy
of a people. They owe their features not to any one historic individual,
but to the imaginative efforts of generations of story-tellers.
The myth of Pandora, the first woman, endowed by the immortals
with heavenly graces, and of Prometheus, who stole fire from heaven
for the use of man; the myth of the earthborn giants that in the
beginning contested with the gods the sovereignty of the universe;
of the moon-goddess who, with her buskined nymphs, pursues the
chase across the azure of the heavens, or descending to earth cherishes
the youth Endymion,&mdash;these myths, germinating in some
quaint and childish interpretation of natural events or in some fireside
fancy, have put forth unconsciously, under the nurture of the
simple folk that conceived and tended them, luxuriant branches and
leaves of narrative, and blossoms of poetic comeliness and form.</p>

<p>The myths that we shall relate present wonderful accounts of the
creation, histories of numerous divine beings, adventures of heroes
in which magical and ghostly agencies play a part, and where
animals and inanimate nature don the attributes of men and gods.
Many of these myths treat of divinities once worshiped by the
Greeks and the Romans, and by our Norse and German forefathers
in the dark ages. Myths, more or less like these, may be
found in the literatures of nearly all nations; many are in the
memories and mouths of savage races at this time existent. But
the stories here narrated are no longer believed by any one. The
so-called divinities of Olympus and of Asgard have not a single
worshiper among men. They dwell only in the realm of memory
and imagination; they are enthroned in the palace of art.</p>

<p>The stories of Greek, Roman, Norse, and German mythology
that have most influenced our English literature will follow in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
order named. The Romans, being by nature a practical, not a
poetic, people, incorporated in their literature the mythology of
the Greeks. We shall, however, append to our description of the
Greek gods a brief account of the native Latin divinities that
retained an individuality in Roman literature.</p>

</div>

<p><b>3. Origin of the World.</b><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There were among the Greeks several
accounts of the beginning of things. Homer tells us that River
Ocean, a deep and mighty flood, encircling land and sea like a
serpent with its tail in its mouth, was the source of all. According
to other myths Night and Darkness were the prime elements
of Nature, and from them sprang Light. Still a third theory,
attributed to Orpheus, asserts that Time was in the beginning,
but had himself no beginning; that from him proceeded Chaos,
a yawning abyss wherein brooded Night and Mist and fiery air,
or &AElig;ther; that Time caused the mist to spin round the central
fiery air till the mass, assuming the form of a huge world egg,
flew, by reason of its rapid rotation, into halves. Of these, one
was Heaven, the other Earth. From the center of the egg proceeded
Eros (Love) and other wondrous beings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>
<p>But the most consistent account of the origin of the world and
of the gods is given by the poet Hesiod, who tells us that Chaos,
the yawning abyss, composed of Void, Mass, and Darkness in
confusion, preceded all things else. Next came into being broad-bosomed
Earth, and beautiful Love who should rule the hearts of
gods and men. But from Chaos itself issued Erebus,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the mysterious
darkness that is under Earth,&mdash;and Night, dwelling in
the remote regions of sunset.</p>

<p>From Mother Earth proceeded first the starry vault of Heaven,
durable as brass or iron, where the gods were to take up their abode.
Earth brought forth next the mountains and fertile fields, the stony
plains, the sea, and the plants and animals that possess them.</p>

<p><b>4. Origin of the Gods.</b> So far we have a history of the throes
and changes of the physical world; now begins the history of
gods and of men. For in the heart of creation Love begins to
stir, making of material things creatures male and female, and
bringing them together by instinctive affinity. First Erebus and
Night, the children of Chaos, are wedded, and from them spring
Light and Day; then <i>Uranus</i>, the personified Heaven, takes <i>G&aelig;a</i>,
the Earth, to wife, and from their union issue Titans and hundred-handed
monsters and Cyclopes.</p>

<p>The <i>Titans</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> appear to be the personification of mighty convulsions
of the physical world, of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.
They played a quarrelsome part in mythical history;
they were instigators of hatred and strife. Homer mentions specially
two of them, Iapetus and Cronus; but Hesiod enumerates
thirteen. Of these, the more important are Oceanus and Tethys,
Hyperion and Thea, Cronus and Rhea, Iapetus, Themis, and
Mnemosyne. The three <i>Cyclopes</i> represented the terrors of rolling
thunder, of the lightning-flash, and of the thunderbolt; and,
probably, for this reason, one fiery eye was deemed enough for
each. The hundred-handed monsters, or <i>Hecatonchires</i>, were also
three in number. In them, probably, the Greeks imaged the sea
with its multitudinous waves, its roar, and its breakers that seem
to shake the earth. These lightning-eyed, these hundred-handed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>monsters, their father Uranus feared, and attempted to destroy by
thrusting them into Tartarus, the profound abysm of the earth.
Whereupon Mother Earth, or G&aelig;a, indignant, called for help upon
her elder children, the Titans. None dared espouse her cause
save Cronus, the crafty. With an iron sickle he lay in wait for
his sire, fell upon him, and drove him, grievously wounded, from
the encounter. From the blood of the mutilated Uranus leaped
into being the Furies, whose heads writhe with serpents; the
Giants, a novel race of monsters; and the Melic Nymphs, invidious
maidens of the ashen spear.</p>

<p><b>5. The Rule of Cronus.</b> Now follows the reign of Cronus, lord
of Heaven and Earth. He is, from the beginning, of incalculable
years. In works of art his head is veiled, to typify his cunning and
his reserve; he bears the sickle not only as memento of the means
by which he brought his father's tyranny to end, but as symbol of
the new period of growth and golden harvests that he ushered in.</p>

<p>For unknown ages Cronus and Rhea, his sister-queen, governed
Heaven and Earth. To them were born three daughters, Vesta,
Ceres, and Juno, and three sons, Pluto, Neptune, and Jupiter.
Cronus, however, having learned from his parents that he should
be dethroned by one of his own children, conceived the well-intentioned
but ill-considered device of swallowing each as it was born.
His queen, naturally desirous of discouraging the practice,&mdash;when
it came to the turn of her sixth child, palmed off on the insatiable
Cronus a stone carefully enveloped in swaddling clothes. Jupiter
(or Zeus), the rescued infant, was concealed in the island of Crete,
where, nurtured by the nymphs Adrastea and Ida, and fed on the
milk of the goat Amalthea, he in due season attained maturity.
Then, assisted by his grandmother G&aelig;a, he constrained Cronus to
disgorge the burden of his cannibal repasts. First came to light
the memorable stone, which was placed in safe keeping at Delphi;
then the five brothers and sisters of Jupiter, ardent to avenge
themselves upon the unnatural author of their existence and
their captivity.</p>

<p><b>6. The War of the Titans.</b> In the war which ensued Iapetus
and all the Titans, except Oceanus, ranged themselves on the side
of their brother Cronus against Jupiter and his recently recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
kinsfolk. Jupiter and his hosts held Mount Olympus. For ages
victory wavered in the balance. Finally Jupiter, acting again under
the advice of G&aelig;a, released from Tartarus, where Uranus had confined
them, the Cyclopes and the Hecatonchires. Instantly they
hastened to the battle-field of Thessaly, the Cyclopes to support
Jupiter with their thunders and lightnings, the hundred-handed
monsters with the shock of the earthquake. Provided with such
artillery, shaking earth and sea, Jupiter issued to the onslaught.
With the gleam of the lightning the Titans were blinded, by the
earthquake they were laid low, with the flames they were well-nigh
consumed: overpowered and fettered by the hands of the Hecatonchires,
they were consigned to the yawning cave of Tartarus.
Atlas, the son of Iapetus, was doomed to bear the heavens on his
shoulders. But a more famous son of the same Titan, Prometheus,
who had espoused the cause of Jove, acquired dignity hereafter to
be set forth.</p>

<p><b>7. The Division of Empire.</b> In the council of the gods that
succeeded, Jupiter was chosen Sovereign of the World. He delegated
to his brother Neptune (or Poseidon) the kingdom of the sea
and of all the waters; to his brother Pluto (or Hades), the government
of the underworld, dark, unseen, mysterious, where the spirits
of the dead should dwell, and of Tartarus, wherein were held the
fallen Titans. For himself Jupiter retained Earth and the Heaven,
into whose broad and sunny regions towered Olympus, the favored
mountain of the greater gods.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><b>8. The Reign of Jupiter.</b> New conflicts, however, awaited this
new dynasty of Heaven&mdash;conflicts, the subject of many a tale
among the ancients. G&aelig;a, though she had aided her grandson
Jupiter in the war against Cronus, was soon seized with compunctions
of conscience; and contemplating the cruel fate of her sons
the Titans, she conceived schemes of vengeance upon their conqueror.
Another son was born to her&mdash;<i>Typhon</i>, a monster more
awful than his predecessors&mdash;whose destiny it was to dispute the
sway of the almighty Zeus. From the neck of Typhon dispread
themselves a hundred dragon-heads; his eyes shot fire, and from
his black-tongued chaps proceeded the hissing of snakes, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>bellowing of bulls, the roaring of lions, the barking of dogs, pipings
and screams, and, at times, the voice and utterance of the
gods themselves. Against Heaven this horror lifted himself; but
quailing before the thunderbolt of Jove, he too descended to
Tartarus, his own place and the abode of his brethren. To this
day, however, he grumbles and hisses, thrusts upward a fiery
tongue through the crater
of a volcano, or, breathing
siroccos, scorches trees and
men.</p>

</div>

<p>Later still, the <i>Giants</i>,
offspring of the blood that
fell from the wounded Uranus,
renewed the revolt
against the Olympian gods.
They were creatures nearer
akin to men than were the
Titans, or the Cyclopes, or
Typhon. They clothed themselves
in the skins of beasts,
and armed themselves with
rocks and trunks of trees.
Their bodies and lower limbs
were of snakes. They were
awful to encounter or to look
upon. They were named, like men, the <i>earthborn</i>; and their
characteristics would suggest some prehistoric brutish race, hotheaded,
not amenable to reason.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Of the Giants, the more mighty
were Alcyoneus of the winter storms and icebergs, Pallas, and
Enceladus, and Porphyrion the fire-king,&mdash;leader of the crew.
In the war against them, Juno and Minerva, divinities of the new
dynasty of Heaven, took active part,&mdash;and Hercules, an earthly
son of Jupiter, whose arrows aided in their defeat. It was from
the overthrow of Pallas that Athena (or Minerva) derived, according
to certain records, her proud designation of Pallas-Athena.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>due course, like the Titans and Typhon, the Giants were buried
in the abyss of eternal darkness. What other outcome can be
expected when mere physical or brute force joins issue with the
enlightened and embattled hosts of heaven?</p>

<p><b>9. The Origin of Man</b> was a question which the Greeks did not
settle so easily as the Hebrews. Greek traditions do not trace all
mankind to an original pair. On the contrary, the generally
received opinion was that men grew out of trees and stones, or
were produced by the rivers or the sea. Some said that men and
gods were both derived from Mother Earth, hence both <i>autochthonous</i>;
and some, indeed, claimed an antiquity for the human race
equal to that of the divinities. All narratives, however, agree in
one statement,&mdash;that the gods maintained intimate relations with
men until, because of the growing sinfulness and arrogance of
mankind, it became necessary for the immortals to withdraw their
favor.</p>

<p><b>10. Prometheus, a Creator.</b> There is a story which attributes
the making of man to Prometheus, whose father Iapetus had,
with Cronus, opposed the sovereignty of Jupiter. In that conflict,
Prometheus, gifted with prophetic wisdom, had adopted the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of the Olympian deities. To him
and his brother Epimetheus was
now committed the office of
making man and providing him
and all other animals with the
faculties necessary for their
preservation. Prometheus was
to overlook the work of Epimetheus.
Epimetheus proceeded
to bestow upon the different
animals the various gifts of
courage, strength, swiftness, sagacity;
wings to one, claws to
another, a shelly covering to a
third. But Prometheus himself
made a nobler animal than these.
Taking some earth and kneading
it with water, he made man
in the image of the gods. He
gave him an upright stature, so
that while other animals turn
their faces toward the earth,
man gazes on the stars. Then
since Epimetheus, always rash,
and thoughtful when too late,
had been so prodigal of his
gifts to other animals that no
blessing was left worth conferring
upon the noblest of creatures,
Prometheus ascended to
heaven, lighted his torch at the
chariot of the sun, and brought
down fire. With fire in his
possession man would be able
to win her secrets and treasures
from the earth, to develop commerce,
science, and the arts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p><b>11. The Age of Gold.</b> Whether in this or in other ways the
world was furnished with inhabitants, the first age was an age of
innocence and happiness. Truth and right prevailed, though not
enforced by law, nor was there any in authority to threaten or to
punish. The forest had not yet been robbed of its trees to yield
timbers for vessels, nor had men built fortifications round their
towns. There were no such things as swords, spears, or helmets.
The earth brought forth all things necessary for man, without his
labor in plowing or sowing. Perpetual spring reigned, flowers
sprang up without seed, the rivers flowed with milk and wine, and
yellow honey distilled from the oaks. This Golden Age had begun
in the reign of Cronus.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> And when these heroes fell asleep in
death, they were translated in a pleasant dream to a spiritual existence,
in which, unseen by mortal eyes, they still attended men as
monitors and guardians.</p>

<p><b>12. The Silver Age</b> came next, inferior to the golden. Jupiter
shortened the spring, and divided the year into seasons. Then, first,
men suffered the extremes of heat and cold, and houses became
necessary. Caves were their dwellings,&mdash;and leafy coverts of the
woods, and huts woven of twigs. Crops would no longer grow without
planting. The farmer was constrained to sow the seed, and the
ox to draw the plow. This was a race of manly men, but insolent
and impious. And when they died, Jupiter made them ghosts of
the underworld, but withheld the privilege of immortal life.</p>

<p><b>13. Prometheus, Champion of Man.</b> During this age when, as
Hesiod says, the altars of the blessed were neglected, and the
gods were denied their due, Prometheus stood forth&mdash;the champion
of man against the Olympians.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> For the son of Cronus had
grudged mortals the use of fire, and was, in fact, contemplating
their annihilation and the creation of a new race. Therefore, once
upon a time, when gods and men were in dispute at Sicyon concerning
the prerogatives of each, Prometheus, by an ingenious
trick, attempted to settle the question in favor of man. Dividing
into two portions a sacrificial bull, he wrapped all the eatable parts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>in the skin, cunningly surmounted with uninviting entrails; but
the bones he garnished with a plausible mass of fat. He then
offered Jupiter his choice. The king of Heaven, although he perceived
the intended fraud, took the heap of bones and fat, and,
forthwith availing himself of this insult as an excuse for punishing
mankind, deprived the race of fire. But Prometheus regained the
treasure, stealing it from Heaven in a hollow tube.</p>

<p><b>14. Pandora.</b> Doubly enraged, Jupiter, in his turn, had recourse
to stratagem. He is declared to have planned for man a curse
in the shape of woman. How the race had persisted hitherto without
woman is a mystery; but that it had done so, with no slight
degree of happiness, the experience of the Golden Age would
seem to prove. However, the bewitching evil was fashioned,&mdash;in
Heaven, properly enough,&mdash;and every god and goddess contributed
something to her perfection. One gave her beauty, another
persuasive charm, a third the faculty of music. And they named
her Pandora, "the gift of all the gods." Thus equipped, she was
conveyed to earth and presented to Epimetheus, who, without
hesitation, accepted the gift, though cautioned by his brother to
beware of Jupiter and all his ways. And the caution was not
groundless. In the hand of Pandora had been placed by the
immortals a casket or vase which she was forbidden to open.
Overcome by an unaccountable curiosity to know what this vessel
contained, she one day lifted the cover and looked in. Forthwith
there escaped a multitude of plagues for hapless man&mdash;gout, rheumatism,
and colic for his body; envy, spite, and revenge for his
mind&mdash;and scattered themselves far and wide. Pandora hastened
to replace the lid; but one thing only remained in the casket, and
that was <i>hope</i>.</p>

<p><b>15. Prometheus Bound.</b> Because of his unselfish devotion to
the cause of humanity, Prometheus drew down on himself the
anger of Olympian Jove, by whose order he was chained to a rock
on Mount Caucasus, and subjected to the attack of an eagle (or a
vulture) which, for ages, preyed upon his liver, yet succeeded not
in consuming it. This state of torment might have been brought
to an end at any time by Prometheus, if he had been willing to
submit to his oppressor; for he possessed a secret which involved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the stability of Jove's throne. This was that by a certain woman
Jove would beget a son who should displace him and end the sway
of the Olympians. The god naturally desired more accurate information
of this decree of Fate. But to reveal the secret Prometheus
disdained. In this steadfastness the Titan was supported by the
knowledge that in the thirteenth generation there should arrive a
hero,&mdash;sprung from Jove himself,&mdash;to release him.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> And in fullness
of time the hero did arrive: none other than the mighty
Hercules desirous of rendering the highest service to mankind.
No higher service, thinks this radiant and masterful personage,&mdash;who,
as we shall see, had already cleared the world of many a
monster,&mdash;remains to be performed than to free the champion of
mankind, suffering through the ages because he had brought light
into the world. "The soul of man," says Hercules to the Titan&mdash;</p>

<p><b>17. The Brazen Age.</b> Next to the Age of Silver came that of
brass,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> more savage of temper and readier for the strife of arms,
yet not altogether wicked.</p>

<p><b>18. The Iron Age.</b> Last came the hardest age and worst,&mdash;of
iron. Crime burst in like a flood; modesty, truth, and honor fled.
The gifts of the earth were put only to nefarious uses. Fraud, violence,
war at home and abroad were rife. The world was wet
with slaughter; and the gods, one by one, abandoned it, Astr&aelig;a,
following last, goddess of innocence and purity.</p>

<p><b>19. The Flood.</b> Jupiter, observing the condition of things,
burned with anger. He summoned the gods to council. Obeying
the call, they traveled the Milky Way to the palace of Heaven.
There, Jupiter set forth to the assembly the frightful condition of
the earth, and announced his intention of destroying its inhabitants,
and providing a new race, unlike the present, which should
be worthier of life and more reverent toward the gods. Fearing
lest a conflagration might set Heaven itself on fire, he proceeded
to drown the world. Not satisfied with his own waters, he called
his brother Neptune to his aid. Speedily the race of men, and
their possessions, were swept away by the deluge.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p><b>20. Deucalion and Pyrrha.</b> Parnassus alone, of the mountains,
overtopped the waves; and there Deucalion, son of Prometheus,
and his wife Pyrrha, daughter of Epimetheus, found refuge&mdash;he
a just man and she a faithful worshiper of the gods. Jupiter, remembering
the harmless lives and pious demeanor of this pair,
caused the waters to recede,&mdash;the sea to return to its shores, and
the rivers to their channels. Then Deucalion and Pyrrha, entering
a temple defaced with slime, approached the unkindled altar
and, falling prostrate, prayed for guidance and aid. The oracle<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
answered, "Depart from the temple with head veiled and garments
unbound, and cast behind you the bones of your mother." They
heard the words with astonishment. Pyrrha first broke silence:
"We cannot obey; we dare not profane the remains of our parents."
They sought the woods, and revolved the oracle in their minds.
At last Deucalion spoke: "Either my wit fails me or the command
is one we may obey without impiety. The earth is the great
parent of all; the stones are her bones; these we may cast behind
us; this, I think, the oracle means. At least, to try will harm us
not." They veiled their faces, unbound their garments, and, picking
up stones, cast them behind them. The stones began to grow
soft and to assume shape. By degrees they put on a rude resemblance
to the human form. Those thrown by Deucalion became
men; those by Pyrrha, women. It was a hard race that sprang up,
and well adapted to labor.</p>

<p><b>21. The Demigods and Heroes.</b> As preceding the Age of Iron,
Hesiod mentions an <i>Age of Demigods and Heroes</i>. Since, however,
these demigods and heroes were, many of them, reputed to
have been directly descended from Deucalion, their epoch must be
regarded as subsequent to the deluge. The hero, Hellen, son of
Deucalion and Pyrrha, became the ancestor of the Hellenes, or
Greeks. The &AElig;olians and Dorians were, according to legend,
descended from his sons &AElig;olus and Dorus; from his son Xuthus,
the Ach&aelig;ans and Ionians derived their origin.</p>

<p>Another great division of the Greek people, the Pelasgic, resident
in the Peloponnesus or southern portion of the peninsula,
was said to have sprung from a different stock of heroes, that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Pelasgus, son of Phoroneus of Argos and grandson of the river-god
Inachus.</p>

<p>The demigods and heroes were of matchless worth and valor.
Their adventures form the subject of many of the succeeding chapters.
The Older Heroes, especially, were endowed with godlike
qualities, which they devoted to the service of mankind in the
destruction of monsters, the founding of cities, or the introduction
of civilization. Such were Perseus, the hero of Argos and his
descendant Hercules, who came to be worshiped as the national
hero of the Greeks. Such, too, Cadmus, the founder of Thebes,
and Cecrops of Athens, and one of his successors, Theseus, a
"second Hercules." Each city of Greece had its patron hero, to
whom it accorded the honors of divinity. The Younger Heroes
were chieftains in the Theban and the Trojan wars and in numerous
other military or predatory expeditions.</p>

<p><b>22. Olympus.</b> The heaven of the Greek gods was the summit
of an ideal mountain called Olympus.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> A gate of clouds, kept by
goddesses, the Hours or Seasons,
opened to permit the passage of the
Celestials to earth, and to receive
them on their return. The gods had
their separate dwellings; but all,
when summoned, repaired to the
palace of Jupiter,&mdash;even the deities
whose usual abode was the earth,
the waters, or the underworld. In the
great hall of the Olympian king the
gods feasted each day on ambrosia
and nectar. Here they conversed of
the affairs of heaven and earth; and
as they quaffed the nectar that Hebe
poured, Apollo made melody with
his lyre and the Muses sang in responsive
strain. When the sun was
set, the gods withdrew to their respective dwellings for the night.</p>

<p>The following lines from the Odyssey express the conception
of Olympus entertained by Homer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So saying, Minerva, goddess, azure-eyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose to Olympus, the reputed seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal of the gods, which never storms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disturb, rains drench, or snow invades, but calm<br /></span>

<p><b>23. The Great Gods.</b> The gods of Heaven were the following:<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>


<ul><li>Jupiter (Zeus).<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></li>
<li>His daughter, Minerva (Athena), who sprang from his brain, full-grown and full-armed.</li>
<li>His sister and wife, Juno (Hera).</li>
<li>His children by Juno,&mdash;Mars (Ares), Vulcan (Heph&aelig;stus), and Hebe.</li>
<li>His children by Latona,&mdash;Apollo, or Ph&oelig;bus, and Diana (Artemis).</li>
<li>His daughter by Dione,&mdash;Venus (Aphrodite).<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></li>
<li>His son by Maia,&mdash;Mercury (Hermes).</li>
<li>His sister, Vesta (Hestia), the oldest born of Cronus and Rhea.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these all were deities of the highest order save Hebe, who
must be ranked with the lesser gods. With the remaining ten
"Great Gods" are sometimes reckoned the other sister of Jupiter,
Ceres (Demeter), properly a divinity of earth, and Neptune
(Poseidon), ruler of the sea.</p>

<p><b>24. Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> (Zeus).</b> The Greek name signifies the radiant light
of heaven. Jupiter was the supreme ruler of the universe, wisest
of the divinities and most glorious. In the Iliad he informs the
other gods that their united strength would not budge him: that, on
the contrary, he could draw them and earth and the seas to himself,
and suspend all from Olympus by a golden chain. Throned
in the high, clear heavens, Jupiter was the gatherer of clouds and
snows, the dispenser of gentle rains and winds, the moderator of
light and heat and the seasons, the thunderer, the wielder of the
thunderbolt. Bodily strength and valor were dear to him. He was
worshiped with various rites in different lands, and to him were
sacred everywhere the loftiest trees and the grandest mountain
peaks. He required of his worshipers cleanliness of surroundings
and person and heart. Justice was his; his to repay violation of
duty in the family, in social relations, and in the state. Prophecy
was his; and his will was made known at the oracle of Dodona,
where answers were given to those who inquired concerning the
future. This oracular shrine was the most ancient in Greece.
According to one account two black doves had taken wing from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>Thebes in Egypt. One flew to Dodona in Epirus, and, alighting
in a grove of oaks, proclaimed to the inhabitants of the district
that they should establish there an oracle of Jupiter. The other
dove flew to the temple of Jupiter Ammon in the Libyan oasis,
and delivered a similar command. According to another account,
these were not doves but priestesses who, carried off from Thebes
by the Ph&oelig;nicians, set up oracles at Oasis and Dodona. The
responses of the oracle were given
by the rustling of the oak trees in
the wind. The sounds were interpreted
by priests.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 7. Zeus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>That Jupiter himself, though
wedded to the goddess Juno, should
be charged with numerous other
love affairs, not only in respect of
goddesses but of mortals, is, in
part, explained by the fact that to
the supreme divinity of the Greeks
have been ascribed attributes and
adventures of numerous local and
foreign divinities that were gradually
identified with him. It is, therefore,
not wise to assume that the
love affairs of Jupiter and of other
divinities always symbolize combinations
of natural or physical forces
that have repeated themselves in
ever-varying guise. It is important to understand that the more
ideal Olympian religion absorbed features of inferior religions,
and that Jupiter, when represented as appropriating the characteristics
of other gods, was sometimes, also, accredited with
their wives.</p>

<p>Beside the children of Jupiter already enumerated, there should
here be mentioned, as of peculiar consequence, Bacchus (Dionysus),
the god of wine, a deity of earth,&mdash;Proserpine, the wife of
Pluto and queen of the underworld,&mdash;and Hercules, the greatest
of the heroes.</p>

</div>

<p><b>25. Conceptions of Jupiter.</b> The Greeks usually conceived the
Jupiter of war as riding in his thunder-car, hurling the thunderbolt
or lashing his enemies with a scourge of lightning. He wore
a breastplate or shield of storm-cloud like the skin of a gray goat
(the <i>&AElig;gis</i>), fearful to behold, and made by the god of fire. His
special messenger was the eagle. It was, however, only with the
passage of generations that the Greeks came to represent their
greatest of the gods by the works of men's hands. The statue of
Olympian Jove by Phidias was considered the highest achievement
of Grecian sculpture. It was of colossal dimensions and, like other
statues of the period, "chryselephantine," that is, composed of
ivory and gold. For the parts representing flesh were of ivory laid
on a framework of wood, while the drapery
and ornaments were of gold. The height
of the figure was forty feet, of the pedestal
twelve. The god was represented as seated
on his throne. His brows were crowned
with a wreath of olive; he held in his right
hand a scepter, and in his left a statue of
Victory. The throne was of cedar, adorned
with gold and precious stones.</p>

<p>The idea which the artist essayed to
embody was that of the supreme deity of
the Hellenic race, enthroned as a conqueror, in perfect majesty
and repose, and ruling with a nod the subject world. Phidias
informs us that the idea was suggested by Homer's lines in the
first book of the Iliad:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jove said, and nodded with his shadowy brows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waved on th' immortal head th' ambrosial locks,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all Olympus trembled at his nod.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, our knowledge of this famous statue is confined to
literary descriptions, and to copies on coins. Other representations
of Jove have been obtained from Greek bronze statuettes, or
the wall-paintings of Herculaneum and Pompeii.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p><b>26. Juno<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> (Hera)</b>, sister and wife of Jupiter. According to some,
the name <i>Hera</i> means Splendor of Heaven, according to others,
the Lady. Some think it approves her goddess of earth; others,
goddess of the air; still others, for reasons by no means final, say
that it signifies Protectress, and applies to Juno in her original function
of moon-goddess, the chosen guardian of women, their aid in
seasons of distress. Juno's union with Jupiter was the prototype of
earthly marriages. She is the type of matronly virtues and dignity.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 9. Hera of Argos</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>She was the daughter of Cronus and Rhea, but was brought up
by Oceanus and Tethys in their dwelling in the remote west
beyond the sea. Without the knowledge
of her parents, she was wedded
to Jupiter in this garden of the gods
where ambrosial rivers flowed, and
where Earth sent up in honor of the
rite a tree of life, heavy with apples
golden like the sunset. Juno was the
most worthy of the goddesses, the
most queenly; ox-eyed, says Homer;
says Hesiod, golden-sandaled and
golden-throned. Glorious beyond
compare was her presence, when
she had harnessed her horses, and
driven forth the golden-wheeled chariot that Hebe made ready,
and that the Hours set aside. Fearful, too, could be her wrath.
For she was of a jealous disposition, which was not happily affected
by the vagaries of her spouse; and she was, moreover, prone to
quarrels, self-willed, vengeful, proud, even on occasion deceitful.
Once, indeed, she conspired with Minerva and Neptune to bind the
cloud-compeller himself. More than once she provoked him to
blows; and once to worse than blows,&mdash;for her lord and master
swung her aloft in the clouds, securing her wrists in golden handcuffs
and hanging anvils to her feet.</p>

<p>The cities that the ox-eyed goddess favored were Argos, Sparta,
and Mycen&aelig;. To her the peacock and the cow were dear, and
many a grove and pasture rejoiced her sacred herds.</p>

</div>

<p><b>27. Minerva</b> (<b>Athene</b> or <b>Athena</b>), the virgin goddess. She sprang
from the brain of Jove, agleam with panoply of war, brandishing a
spear and with her battle-cry awakening the echoes of heaven and
earth. She is goddess of the lightning that leaps like a lance from
the cloud-heavy sky, and hence, probably, the name <i>Athene</i>.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> She
is goddess of the storms and of the rushing thunderbolt, and is,
therefore, styled Pallas. She is
the goddess of the thundercloud,
which is symbolized by her tasseled
breastplate of goatskin, the
<i>&aelig;gis</i>, whereon is fixed the head of
Medusa, the Gorgon, that turns to
stone all beholders. She is also the
goddess of war, rejoicing in martial music and
protecting the war horse and the warship. On
the other hand, she is of a gentle, fair, and
thoughtful aspect. Her Latin name <i>Minerva</i>
is connected with the Sanskrit, Greek, and
Latin words for <i>mind</i>. She is eternally a
virgin, the goddess of wisdom, of skill, of contemplation,
of spinning and weaving, of horticulture
and agriculture. She is protectress of
cities, and was specially worshiped in her own
Athens, in Argos, in Sparta, and in Troy. To
her were sacrificed oxen and cows. The olive
tree, created by her, was sacred to her, and also
the owl, the cock, the serpent, and the crow.</p>

<p><b>28. Mars (Ares)</b>,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> the war-god, son of Jupiter and Juno. The
meaning of the name <i>Ares</i> is uncertain; the most probable significations
are the <i>Slayer</i>, the <i>Avenger</i>, the <i>Curse</i>. The Roman
god of war, Mars, is the <i>bright</i> and <i>burning</i> one. Homer, in the
Iliad, represents Ares as the insatiable warrior of the heroic age,
who, impelled by rage and lust of violence, exults in the noise
of battle, revels in the horror of carnage. Strife and slaughter
are the condition of his existence. Where the fight is thickest,
there he rushes in without hesitation, without question as to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>side is right. In battle array he is resplendent,&mdash;on his head
the gleaming helmet and floating plume, on his arm the leathern
shield, in his hand the redoubtable spear of bronze. Well-favored,
stately, swift, unwearied, puissant, gigantic, he is still the foe of
wisdom, the scourge of mortals. Usually he fights on foot, sometimes
from a chariot drawn by four horses,&mdash;the offspring of the
North Wind and a Fury. In the fray
his sons attend him,&mdash;Terror, Trembling,
Panic, and Fear,&mdash;also his
sister Eris, or Discord (the mother of
Strife), his daughter Enyo, ruiner of
cities, and a retinue of bloodthirsty
demons. As typifying the chances of
war, Mars is, of course, not always
successful. In the battles before Troy,
Minerva and Juno bring him more
than once to grief; and when he complains
to Jupiter, he is snubbed as a
renegade most hateful of all the gods.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
His loved one and mistress is the goddess
of beauty herself. In her arms the
warrior finds repose. Their daughter
Harmonia is the ancestress of the
unquiet dynasty of Thebes. The favorite
land of Mars was, according to
Homer, the rough, northerly Thrace.
His emblems are the spear and the
burning torch; his chosen animals
are haunters of the battle field,&mdash;the vulture and the dog.</p>

<p><b>29. Vulcan (Heph&aelig;stus)</b>, son of Jupiter and Juno, was the god
of fire, especially of terrestrial fire,&mdash;volcanic eruption, incendiary
flame, the glow of the forge or the hearth. But as the fires
of earth are derived from that of heaven, perhaps the name
<i>Heph&aelig;stus</i> (burning, shining, flaming) referred originally to the
marvelous brilliance of the lightning. Vulcan was the blacksmith
of the gods, the finest artificer in metal among them. His forge in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>Olympus was furnished not only with anvils and all other implements
of the trade, but with automatic handmaidens of silver and gold,
fashioned by Vulcan himself. Poets later than Homer assign to
Vulcan workshops under various volcanic islands. From the crater
of Mount &AElig;tna poured
forth the fumes and
flames of his smithy.
He built the dwellings
of the gods; he made
the scepter of Jove, the
shields and spears of
the Olympians, the arrows
of Apollo and
Diana, the breastplate
of Hercules, the shield
of Achilles.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 12. Ares (Mars)</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>He was lame of gait,&mdash;a
figurative suggestion,
perhaps, of the flickering, unsteady nature of fire. According
to his own story,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> he was born halt; and his mother, chagrined by
his deformity, cast him from Heaven out of the sight of the gods.
Yet, again,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> he says that, attempting once to save his mother
from Jupiter's wrath,
he was caught by the
foot and hurled by the
son of Cronus from
the heavenly threshold:
"All day I flew;
and at the set of sun
I fell in Lemnos, and
little life was left in
me." Had he not been
lame before, he had good reason to limp after either of these
catastrophes. He took part in the making of the human race, and
in the special creation of Pandora. He assisted also at the birth of
Minerva, to facilitate which he split Jupiter's head open with an ax.</p>

<p>His wife, according to the Iliad and Hesiod's Theogony, is
Aglaia, the youngest of the Graces; but in the Odyssey it is
Venus. He is a glorious, good-natured god, loved and honored
among men as the founder of wise customs and the patron of
artificers; on occasion, as a god of healing and of prophecy. He
seems to have been, when he chose, the cause of "inextinguishable
laughter" to the gods, but he was by no means a fool. The famous
god of the strong arms could be cunning, even
vengeful, when the emergency demanded.</p>

</div>

<p><b>30. Apollo</b>, or Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, the son
of Jupiter and Latona, was pre&euml;minently
the god of the sun. His name <i>Ph&oelig;bus</i> signifies
the radiant nature of the sunlight; his
name <i>Apollo</i>, perhaps, the cruel and destructive
heat of noonday. Soon after his birth,
Jupiter would have sent him to Delphi to
inculcate righteousness and justice among the
Greeks; but the golden god Apollo chose
first to spend a year in the land of the
Hyperboreans, where for six continuous
months of the year there is sunshine and
spring, soft climate, profusion of herbs and
flowers, and the very ecstasy of life. During
this delay the Delphians sang p&aelig;ans,&mdash;hymns
of praise,&mdash;and danced in chorus
about the tripod (or three-legged stool),
where the expectant priestess of Apollo had
taken her seat. At last, when the year was
warm, came the god in his chariot drawn by swans,&mdash;heralded by
songs of springtide, of nightingales and swallows and crickets.
Then the crystal fount of Castalia and the stream Cephissus overflowed
their bounds, and mankind made grateful offerings to the
god. But his advent was not altogether peaceful. An enormous
serpent, Python, had crept forth from the slime with which, after
the flood, the Earth was covered; and in the caves of Mount
Parnassus this terror of the people lurked. Him Apollo encountered
and after fearful combat slew, with arrows, weapons which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the god of the silver bow had not before used against any but feeble
animals,&mdash;hares, wild goats, and such game. In commemoration
of this illustrious conquest, he instituted the Pythian games, in
which the victor in feats of strength, swiftness of foot, or in the
chariot race, should be crowned with a wreath of beech leaves.
Apollo brought not only the warm spring and summer, but also
the blessings of the harvest. He warded off the dangers and diseases
of summer and autumn;
and he healed the sick. He
was patron of music and of
poetry. Through his oracle
at Delphi, on the slopes of
Parnassus in Phocis, the
Pythian god made known
the future to those who
consulted him. He was a
founder of cities, a promoter
of colonization, a giver of
good laws, the ideal of fair
and manly youth,&mdash;a pure
and just god, requiring clean
hands and pure hearts of
those that worshiped him.
But though a god of life
and peace, the far-darter
did not shun the weapons
of war. When presumption
was to be punished, or
wrong righted, he could bend his bow and slay with the arrows of
his sunlight. As in the days of his youth he slew the Python, so, also,
he slew the froward Tityus, and so the children of Niobe. While
Ph&oelig;bus Apollo is the Olympian divinity of the sun, fraught with
light and healing, spiritual, creative, and prophetic, he must not
be confounded with a god of the older dynasty, Helios (offspring
of Hyperion, Titanic deity of light), who represented the sun in
its daily and yearly course, in its physical rather than spiritual manifestation.
The bow of Apollo was bound with laurel in memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of Daphne, whom he loved. To him were sacred, also, many
creatures,&mdash;the wolf, the roe, the mouse, the he-goat, the ram,

</div>

<p><b>32. Diana (Artemis)</b>, twin sister of Apollo, was born on Mount
Cynthus in the island of Delos. Latona, the future mother of
Diana and Apollo, flying
from the wrath of Juno,
had besought, one after
another, the islands of the
&AElig;gean to afford her a
place of rest; but they
feared too much the potent
queen of heaven. Delos
alone consented to become
the birthplace of the future
deities. This isle was then
floating and unstable; but
on Latona's arrival, Jupiter
fastened it with adamantine
chains to the bottom
of the sea, that it might be
a secure resting-place for
his beloved. The daughter
of Latona is, as her name
<i>Artemis</i> indicates, a virgin
goddess, the ideal of modesty,
grace, and maidenly vigor. She is associated with her brother,
the prince of archery, in nearly all his adventures, and in attributes
she is his feminine counterpart. As he is identified with sunlight,
so is she, his fair-tressed sister, with the chaste brilliance of the
moon. Its slender arc is her bow; its beams are her arrows with
which she sends upon womankind a speedy and painless death.
In her prerogative of moon-goddess she is frequently identified
with Selene, daughter of Hyperion, just as Apollo is with Helios.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Despising the weakness of love, Diana imposed upon her nymphs
vows of perpetual maidenhood, any violation of which she was
swift and severe to punish. Graceful in form and free of movement,
equipped for the chase, and surrounded by a bevy of fair
companions, the swift-rushing goddess was wont to scour hill,
valley, forest, and plain. She was, however, not only huntress,
but guardian, of wild beasts,&mdash;mistress withal of horses and kine
and other domestic brutes. She
ruled marsh and mountain; her
gleaming arrows smote sea as
well as land. Springs and woodland
brooks she favored, for in
them she and her attendants
were accustomed to bathe. She
blessed with verdure the meadows
and arable lands, and from
them obtained a meed of thanks.
When weary of the chase she
turned to music and dancing;
for the lyre and flute and song
were dear to her. Muses, Graces,
nymphs, and the fair goddesses
themselves thronged the rites of
the chorus-leading queen. But
ordinarily a woodland chapel or
a rustic altar sufficed for her
worship. There the hunter laid
his offering&mdash;antlers, skin, or
edible portions of the deer that Artemis of the golden arrows had
herself vouchsafed him. The holy maid, however, though naturally
gracious, gentle, and a healer of ills, was, like her brother, quick to
resent injury to her sacred herds or insult to herself. To this stern
temper Agamemnon, Orion, and Niobe bore regretful testimony.
They found that the "fair-crowned queen of the echoing chase,"
though blithe and gracious, was by no means a frivolous personage.</p>

<p><b>34. Venus (Aphrodite)</b>, goddess of love and beauty, was, according
to the more ancient Greek conception, a daughter of Jupiter
and Dione;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> but Hesiod says that she arose from the foam of the
sea at the time of the wounding of Uranus, and therefore was called,
by the Greeks, Aphrodite, <i>the foam-born</i>.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Wafted by the west
wind, and borne upon the surge, she won first the island of Cythera;
thence, like a dream, she passed to Cyprus, where the grace and
blossom of her beauty conquered every heart. Everywhere, at the
touch of her feet the herbage quivered into flower. The Hours
and Graces surrounded her, twining odorous garlands and weaving
robes for her that reflected the hues and breathed the perfume
of crocus and hyacinth, violet, rose, lily, and narcissus. To her
influence is ascribed the fruitfulness of the animal and of the vegetable
creation. She is goddess of gardens and flowers, of the rose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>the myrtle, and the linden. The heaths and slumberous vales,
pleasant with spring and vernal breezes, are hers. In her broidered
girdle lurk "love and desire, and loving converse that steals the
wits even of the wise." For she is the mistress of feminine charm
and beauty, the golden, sweetly smiling Aphrodite, who rules the
hearts of men. She lends to mortals seductive form and fascination.
To a few, indeed, her favor is a blessing; but to many her
gifts are treacherous, destructive of peace. Her various influence
is exemplified in the stories of Pygmalion and Adonis, Paris and
&AElig;neas, Helen, Ariadne, Psyche, Procris, Pasipha&euml;, and Ph&aelig;dra.
Her power extended over sea as well as land, and her temples
rose from many a shore. On the waters swan and dolphin were
beloved of her; in air, the sparrow and the dove. She was usually
attended by her winged son Cupid, of whom much is to be told.
Especially dear to her were Cyprus, Cnidos, Paphos, Cythera,
Abydos, Mount Eryx, and the city of Corinth.</p>

<p><b>35. The "Venus of Milo."</b> Of artistic conceptions of Aphrodite,

and the Venus of the Medici.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> A comparison of the two conceptions

</div>

<p><b>36. Mercury (Hermes)</b>, born in a cave of Mount Cyllene in
Arcadia, was the son of Jupiter and Maia (the daughter of Atlas).
According to conjecture, his name <i>Hermes</i> means the <i>Hastener</i>.
Mercury, swift as the
wind, was the servant
and herald of Jupiter
and the other gods.
On his ankles (in plastic
art), and his low-crowned,
broad-brimmed
<i>petasus</i>, or hat, were
wings. As messenger
of Heaven, he bore
a wand (<i>caduceus</i>) of
wood or of gold, twined
with snakes and surmounted
by wings, and
possessed of magical
powers over sleeping,
waking, and dreams.
He was beautiful and
ever in the prime of
youthful vigor. To a voice sweet-toned and powerful, he added
the persuasiveness of eloquence. But his skill was not confined
to speech; he was also the first of inventors&mdash;to him are ascribed
the lyre and the flute. He was the forerunner, too, of mathematicians
and astronomers. His agility and strength made him easily
prince in athletic pursuits. His cunning rendered him a dangerous
foe; he could well play the trickster and the thief, as Apollo found
out to his vexation, and Argus, and many another unfortunate.
His methods, however, were not always questionable; although
the patron of gamblers and the god of chance, he, at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
time, was the furtherer of lawful industry and of commerce by land
and sea. The gravest function of the Messenger was to conduct
the souls of the dead, "that gibber like bats as they fare, down the
dank ways, past the streams of Oceanus, past the gates of the sun
and the land of dreams, to the mead of asphodel in the dark realm
of Hades, where dwell the souls, the phantoms of men outworn."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><b>37. Vesta (Hestia)</b>, goddess of the hearth, public and private,
was the first-born child of Cronus and Rhea and, accordingly, the
elder sister of Jupiter, Juno, Neptune, Pluto, and Ceres. Vesta
was an old maid by choice. Averse to Venus and all her ways,
she scorned the flattering advances of both Neptune and Apollo,
and resolved to remain single. Whereupon Jupiter gave her to
sit in the middle of his palace, to receive in Olympus the choicest
morsels of the feast, and, in the temples of the gods on earth,
reverence as the oldest and worthiest of Olympian divinities. As
goddess of the burning hearth, Vesta is the divinity of the home:
of settled, in opposition to nomadic, habits of life. She was worshiped
first of the gods at every feast. Before her shrine in
city and state the holy flame was religiously cherished. From her
altars those of the other gods obtained their fires. No new colony,
no new home, was duly consecrated till on its central hearth there
glowed coals from her ancestral hearth. In her temple at Rome a
sacred fire, tended by six virgin priestesses called Vestals, was
kept religiously aflame. As the safety of the city was held to be
connected with its conservation, any negligence, by which it might
go out, was severely punished. Whenever the fire did die, it was
rekindled from the rays of the sun.</p>

<p><b>38.</b> Of the <b>Lesser Divinities of Heaven</b> the most worthy of
mention are:</p>

<p>1. <i>Cupid (Eros)</i>, small but mighty god of love, the son of
Venus and her constant companion. He was often represented
with eyes covered because of the blindness of his actions. With
his bow and arrows, he shot the darts of desire into the bosoms of
gods and men. Another deity named <i>Anteros</i>, reputed the brother
of Eros, was sometimes represented as the avenger of slighted
love, and sometimes as the symbol of reciprocal affection. Venus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>was also attended at times by another brother of Eros, <i>Himeros</i>, or
Longing, and by <i>Hymen</i>, a beautiful youth of divine descent, the
personification of the wedding feast
and leader of the nuptial chorus. Of
Eros the poet Gosse writes:</p>

<p>2. <i>Hebe</i>, daughter of Jupiter and
Juno, goddess of youth and cupbearer
to the gods. According to one story, she resigned that office on
becoming the wife of Hercules. According to another, Hebe was
dismissed from her position in consequence of a fall which she
met with one day when in attendance on the gods. Her successor
was <i>Ganymede</i>, a Trojan boy whom Jupiter, in the disguise of an
eagle, seized and carried off from the midst of his playfellows on
Mount Ida, bore up to Heaven, and installed in the vacant place.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Graces</i>, daughters of Jove by Eurynome, daughter of
Oceanus. They were goddesses presiding over the banquet, the
dance, all social pleasures, and polite accomplishments. They were
three in number,&mdash;Euphrosyne, Aglaia, and Thalia. Spenser describes
the office of the Graces thus:</p>

<p>4. <i>The Muses</i>, daughters of Jupiter and Mnemosyne (Memory).
They presided over song and prompted the memory. They are
ordinarily cited as nine in number; and to each of them was
assigned patronage in some department of literature, art, or
science. Calliope was the muse of epic poetry, Clio of history,
Euterpe of lyric poetry, Melpomene of tragedy, Terpsichore of
choral dance and song, Erato of love poetry, Polyhymnia of sacred
poetry, Urania of astronomy, Thalia of comedy.</p>

they were daughters of
Night.</p>

of Night. She represented
the righteous anger and
vengeance of the gods,
particularly toward the
proud, the insolent, and
breakers of the law.</p>

<p>8. <i>&AElig;sculapius</i>, son
of Apollo. By his skill
in medicine he restored
the dead to life. Being
killed by the lightning
of Jove, he was translated
to the ranks of
Heaven. His function
was the art of healing.</p>

<p>9. <i>The Winds</i>,&mdash;Boreas,
or Aquilo, the
north wind; Zephyrus, or Favonius, the west; Notus, or Auster, the
south; and Eurus, the east. The first two, chiefly, have been celebrated
by the poets, the former as the type of rudeness, the latter of
gentleness. It is said that Boreas loved the nymph Orithyia and
tried to play the lover's part, but met with poor success; for it was
hard for him to breathe gently, and sighing was out of the question.</p>

<p>Weary at last of fruitless endeavors, he acted out his true character,
seized the maiden and bore her off. Their children were Zetes and
Cala&iuml;s, winged warriors, who accompanied the Argonautic expedition
and did good service in an encounter with those monstrous birds,
the Harpies. Zephyrus
was the lover of Flora
(Chloris).</p>

<p>Here, too, may be
mentioned &AElig;olus, the
king of the winds,
although he is not
a lesser divinity of
Heaven. His palace
was on the precipitous
isle of &AElig;olia,
where, with his six
sons and six daughters, he kept eternal carouse. The winds, which
he confined in a cavern, he let loose as he saw fit or as he was
bidden by superior deities. He is sometimes called Hippotades.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>10. <i>Helios</i>, <i>Selene</i>, and <i>Eos</i>, children of the Titan Hyperion.
Helios and Selene
were the more ancient
Greek divinities
of Sun and Moon respectively.
Helios, the
charioteer of the sun,
is, as has been already
said, frequently identified
with his successor,
Apollo. The attributes
and adventures of
Selene were merged
in those of the more modern Diana. Eos, or, in Latin nomenclature,
Aurora, the rosy-fingered goddess of the Morn, was mother
of the stars and of the morning and evening breezes. Saffron-robed
she rises from the streams of Ocean, to bring light to gods and men.</p>

</div>

<p>11. <i>Phosphor</i>, the morning-star, the star of Venus, son of Aurora
and the hunter Cephalus. <i>Hesper</i>, the evening-star, was sometimes
identified with Phosphor.
He was king of the
Western Land, and, say some,
father of the Hesperides, who
guarded the golden apples
of the sunset.</p>

<p>The Spirit in Milton's
Comus tells of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">... the gardens fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hesperus, and his daughters three<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sing about the golden tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the crisp&egrave;d shades and bowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revels the spruce and jocund Spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Graces and the rosy-bosomed Hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither all their bounties bring.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Than her purfled scarf can shew.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Tennyson taking the lines as a text has written the melodious
and mystic song of the Hesperides, beginning&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The golden apple, the golden apple, the hallowed fruit,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sleep and stir not: all is mute.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ye sing not, if ye make false measure,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Laugh not loudly: watch the treasure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the wisdom of the West.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Readers of this poem will notice that Tennyson follows the
tradition by which a sleepless dragon is introduced among the
guardians of the Hesperian fruit. Still other versions substitute
for Hesperus, the Titan Atlas.</p>

<p>12. <i>Various Other Personifications.</i> The constellation Orion,
whose story will be narrated; Victoria (Nike), the goddess of
Victory; Discors (Eris), the goddess of Strife; and Iris, goddess
of the rainbow, who is represented frequently as a messenger of
the gods.</p>

</div>

<p><b>39. Conception of the World.</b> The Greek poets believed the
earth to be flat and circular. In their opinion their own country
occupied the middle
of it, and the central
point was either Mount
Olympus, the abode of
the gods, or Delphi,
famous for its oracle.
The circular disk of the
earth was crossed from
west to east and divided
into two equal parts by
the <i>Sea</i>, as they called
the Mediterranean and
its continuation the
Euxine, the only seas
with which they were
acquainted. Around
the earth flowed <i>River</i>
<i>Ocean</i>, from south to
north on the western
side, in a contrary direction
on the eastern. It
flowed in a steady, equable
current, unvexed by
storm or tempest. The
sea and all the rivers on earth received their waters from it.</p>

<p>The northern portion of the earth was inhabited by the Hyperboreans,
dwelling in bliss and everlasting spring beyond the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>mountains whose caverns sent forth the piercing blasts of the
north wind. Their country was inaccessible by land or sea. They
lived exempt from disease or old age, from toils and warfare. "I
come" sings one of them,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I come from a land in the sun-bright deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where golden gardens glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the winds of the north, becalmed in sleep,<br /></span>

</div>

<p>On the south side of the earth, close to the stream of Ocean,
dwelt the &AElig;thiopians, whom the gods held in such favor that they
left at times the Olympian abodes
to partake of the &AElig;thiopian sacrifices
and banquets. On the western
margin of the earth, by the
stream of Ocean, lay the Elysian
Plain, where certain mortals enjoyed
an immortality of bliss.</p>

<p>The Dawn, the Sun, and the
Moon were supposed to rise out of
Ocean on the eastern side and to
drive through the air, giving light
to gods and men. The stars, also,
except those forming the Wain or
Bear and others near them, rose
out of and sank into the stream
of Ocean. There the sun-god
embarked in a winged boat, which
conveyed him by the northern part
of the earth back to his place of
rising in the east.</p>

<p><b>40. Ceres (Demeter)</b>, the goddess
of sowing and reaping, of
harvest festivals, and of agriculture in general, was sister of Jupiter
and daughter of Cronus and Rhea. She is connected through her
daughter Proserpine, queen of Hades, with the holy ceremonies and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>rites of death and of the lower world. Of the institutions founded
or favored by her the most important were the mysteries celebrated
at Eleusis, concerning which we know that, in the presence of individuals
initiated in the secret ritual and
perhaps with their co&ouml;peration, scenes
were enacted which represented the
alternation of death and life in nature
and, apparently, forecast the resurrection
and immortality of man. Sacred
to Ceres and to Proserpine were golden
sheaves of corn and soporific poppies;
while, among animals, cows, sheep, and
pigs were acceptable to them.</p>

<p><b>41. G&aelig;a (Ge)</b>, the Mother Earth,
wife of Uranus, belongs to the older
order of gods; so also, another goddess
of the earth, <i>Rhea</i>, the wife of
Cronus and mother of Jupiter. In
Phrygia, Rhea became identified with
<i>Cybele</i>, whose worship, as mother of
the gods, was at a later period introduced
into Rome. The Greek mother,
Rhea, was attended by the Curetes; the
Phrygian mother by the Corybantes,
who celebrated her orgies with enthusiastic din of trumpets, drums,
and cymbals. Cybele presided over mountain fastnesses and fortified
places.</p>

<p><b>42. Bacchus (Dionysus)</b>, the god of wine, was the son of Jupiter
and Semele, daughter of Cadmus of Thebes. He was especially
the god of animal life and vegetation. He represented not only
the intoxicating power of wine but its social and beneficent influences,
and was looked upon as a promoter of civilization, a lawgiver,
and a lover of peace. His forehead was crowned with vine
leaves or ivy. He rode upon the tiger, the panther, or the lynx,
or was drawn by them in a car. His worshipers were Bacchanals,
or Bacchantes. He was attended by Satyrs and Sileni and by
women called M&aelig;nads, who, as they danced and sang, waved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
the air the <i>thyrsus</i>, a staff entwined with ivy and surmounted by
a pine cone. Ordinarily, as in the following verses by Dryden, the
convivial qualities of the god overshadow all the rest:</p>

<p><b>43. The Lesser Divinities of Earth</b> were:</p>

<p>1. <i>Pan</i>, son of Mercury and a wood-nymph or
Dryad. He was the god of woods and fields, of
flocks and shepherds. He dwelt in caves, wandered
on the mountains and in valleys, amused himself
with the chase, led the dances of the Dryads,
and made love to them. But his suit was frequently
of no avail, for though good-natured he
was not prepossessing; his hoofs and horns did
not enhance his comeliness. He was fond of
music and was himself inventor of the syrinx,
or shepherd's pipe, which he played in a masterly
manner. Like other gods who dwelt in forests,
he was dreaded by those whose occupations caused
them to pass through the woods by night; for
gloom and loneliness oppress and appall the mind. Hence sudden
unreasonable fright was ascribed to Pan and called a Panic terror.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Nymphs.</i> Pan's partners in the dance, the Dryads,
were but one of several classes of nymphs. There were, beside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>them, the Oreads, nymphs of mountains and grottoes; and the
Water-Nymphs, who are mentioned in later sections.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Satyrs</i>, deities of the woods and fields. In early art
they appear as bearded creatures with snub noses, goats' ears, and
horses' tails. Later they resemble youths, sometimes with sprouting
horns. The goat-legged satyr is found in Roman poetry.</p>

<p><b>44. The Underworld</b> was the region of darkness inhabited by
the spirits of the dead and governed by Pluto (Hades) and Proserpina,
his queen. According to the Iliad, this realm lay "beneath
the secret places of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> And from the Odyssey we gather
that it is not in the bowels of the earth, but on the under side at the
limits of the known world, across the stream Oceanus, where is a
waste shore, the land of the Cimmerians, shrouded in mist and
cloud, never lighted by the sun "neither when he climbs up the
starry heavens nor when again he turns earthward from the firmament."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
From that land one goes beside the stream till he reaches
the dank house of Hades. The realm of darkness is bounded by
awful rivers: the Styx, sacred even among the gods, for by it they
sealed their oaths, and the Acheron, river of woe,&mdash;with its tributaries,
Phlegethon, river of fire, and Cocytus, river of wailing.
Hither past the White Rock, which perhaps symbolizes the bleaching
skeletons of the dead, and past the gates of the sun, it is the
duty of Hermes (Mercury) to conduct the outworn ghosts of mortals.
One of the Greek dramatists, Sophocles, tells us that this
shore of death is "down in the darkling west."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In later poems we
read that Charon, a grim boatman, received the dead at the River
of Woe, and ferried them across, if the money requisite for their
passage had been placed in their mouths and their bodies had been
duly buried in the world above.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Otherwise he left them gibbering
on the hither bank. The abode of Pluto is represented as wide-gated
and thronged with guests. At the gate Cerberus, a three-headed,
serpent-tailed dog, lay on guard,&mdash;friendly to the spirits entering,
but inimical to those who would depart. The palace itself
is dark and gloomy,
set in the midst of uncanny
fields haunted
by strange apparitions.
The groves of somber
trees about the palace,&mdash;the
meads of Asphodel,
barren or, at
best, studded with
futile bushes and pale-flowered
weeds, where
wander the shades,&mdash;and
the woods along
the waste shore "of
tall poplars and willows
that shed their fruit before the season" are, without any particular
discrimination, celebrated by the poets as the <i>Garden of Proserpine</i>.</p>

<p><b>45. Tartarus and the Elysian Fields.</b> With the ghosts of Hades
the living might but rarely communicate, and only through certain
oracles of the dead, situate by cavernous spots and sheer abysms,
deep and melancholy streams, and baleful marshes. These naturally
seemed to afford access to the world below, which with the later
poets, such as Virgil, comes to be regarded as under the ground.
One of these descents to the Underworld was near T&aelig;narum in
Laconia; another, near Cum&aelig; in Italy, was Lake Avernus, so foul
in its exhalations that, as its name portends, no bird could fly across
it.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Before the judges of the
lower world,&mdash;Minos, &AElig;acus,
and Rhadamanthus,&mdash;the souls
of the dead were brought to trial.
The condemned were assigned to
regions where all manner of torment
awaited them at the hands
of monsters dire,&mdash;the fifty-headed
Hydra and the avenging
Furies. Some evildoers, such as
the Titans of old, were doomed to
languish in the gulf of Tartarus
immeasurably below. But the
souls of the guiltless passed to
the Elysian Fields, where each
followed the chosen pursuit of
his former life in a land of spring, sunlight, happiness, and song.
And by the Fields there flowed the river Lethe, from which the
souls of those that were to return to the earth in other bodies
drank oblivion of their former lives.</p>

<p><b>46. The Islands of the Blest.</b> Homer mentions, elsewhere, an
Elysium of the western seas, which is a happy land, "where life is
easiest for men: no snow is there, nor yet great storm, nor any
rain; but always ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the shrill
West to blow cool on men."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Hither favored heroes pass without
dying, and live under the happy rule of Rhadamanthus. The
Elysium of Hesiod and Pindar is likewise in the Western Ocean,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>on the Islands of the Blessed, the Fortunate Isles. From this
dream of a western Elysium may have sprung the legend of the
island Atlantis. That blissful region may have been wholly imaginary.
It is, however, not impossible that the myth had its origin
in the reports of storm-driven mariners who had caught a glimpse
of occidental lands. In these Islands of the Blest, the Titans,
released from Tartarus after many years, dwelt under the golden
sway of the white-haired Cronus.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><b>47. Pluto (Hades)</b> was brother of Jupiter. To him fell the sovereignty
of the lower world and the shades of the dead. In his
character of Hades, the viewless, he is hard and inexorable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>By virtue of the helmet or cap given him by the Cyclopes, he
moved hither and yon, dark, unseen,&mdash;hated of mortals. He was,
however, lord not only of all that descends to the bowels of the
earth, but of all that proceeds from the earth; and in the latter
aspect he was revered as Pluto, or the giver of wealth. At his
pleasure he visited the realms of day,&mdash;as when he carried off
Proserpina; occasionally he journeyed to Olympus; but otherwise
he ignored occurrences in the upper
world, nor did he suffer his subjects,
by returning, to find them out. Mortals,
when they called on his name,
beat the ground with their hands and,
averting their faces, sacrificed black
sheep to him and to his queen.
Among the Romans he is known also
as Dis, Orcus, and Tartarus. But
Orcus is rather Death, or the Underworld,
than ruler of the shades.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 38. Hades</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><b>48. Proserpina (Persephone)</b> was the
daughter of Ceres and Jupiter. She was
queen of Hades,&mdash;a name applied both
to the ruler of the shades and to his
realm. When she is goddess of spring,
dear to mankind, Proserpina bears a
cornucopia overflowing with flowers,
and revisits the earth in duly recurring
season. But when she is goddess of death, sitting beside Pluto,
she directs the Furies, and, like her husband, is cruel, unyielding,
inimical to youth and life and hope. In the story of her
descent to Hades will be found a further account of her attributes
and fortunes.</p>

<p><b>49. The Lesser Divinities of the Underworld</b> were:</p>

<p>1. <i>&AElig;acus</i>, <i>Rhadamanthus</i>, and <i>Minos</i>, sons of Jupiter and
judges of the shades in the lower world. &AElig;acus had been during
his earthly life a righteous king of the island of &AElig;gina. Minos had
been a famous lawgiver and king of Crete. The life of Rhadamanthus
was not eventful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>The Furies</i> (<i>Erinyes</i> or <i>Eumenides</i>), Alecto, Tisiphone, and
Meg&aelig;ra, born of the blood of the wounded Uranus. They were
attendants of Proserpina. They punished with the frenzies of
remorse the crimes of those who had escaped from or defied
public justice. The heads of the Furies were wreathed with
serpents.</p>

<p>3. <i>Hecate</i>, a mysterious divinity sometimes identified with Diana
and sometimes with Proserpina. As Diana represents the moonlight
splendor of night, so Hecate represents its darkness and terrors.
She haunted crossroads and graveyards, was the goddess of sorcery
and witchcraft, and wandered by
night, seen only by the dogs whose
barking told of her approach.</p>

and <i>Death (Thanatos)</i>, sons of
Night.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> They dwell in subterranean
darkness. The former brings

too, are sons of Night.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> They dwell beside their brother Death,
along the Western Sea. Their abode has two gates,&mdash;one of
ivory, whence issue false and flattering visions; the other of horn,
through which true dreams and noble pass to men.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

</div>

<p><b>50. The Older Dynasty.</b> There were two dynasties of the sea.
The Older, which flourished during the rule of Cronus, was founded
by the Titans, <i>Oceanus</i> and <i>Tethys</i>,
from whom sprang three thousand
rivers and ocean-nymphs unnumbered.
The palace of Oceanus was
beyond the limits of the bountiful
earth,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> surrounded by gardens and
all things fair. From ages immemorial
another dweller in the glimmering
caves of Ocean was <i>Pontus</i> (the
<i>deep sea</i> or the <i>waterway</i>), who
became, by Mother Earth, father of
Nereus. This <i>Nereus</i>, a genial old
man of the sea, was distinguished
for his prophetic gifts, his knowledge,
his love of truth and justice.
Taking to wife one of the daughters
of Oceanus, the nymph Doris, he
was blessed with a family of fifty fair
daughters, the <i>Nere&iuml;ds</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Of these
daughters the most famous are
Panope, Galatea, Thetis, and Amphitrite; the last of whom gave
her hand to Neptune (Poseidon), brother of Jove, and thus united
the Older and the Younger dynasties of the sea.</p>

<p><b>51.</b> Of the <b>Younger Dynasty</b> of the waters <i>Neptune</i> and
<i>Amphitrite</i> were the founders. Neptune's palace was in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>depths of the sea, near &AElig;g&aelig; in
Eub&oelig;a; but he made his home
on Olympus when he chose. The
symbol of his power was the
trident, or three-pronged spear,
with which he could shatter rocks,
call forth or subdue storms, and
shake the shores of earth. He
created the horse and was the
patron of horse races. His own
steeds were brazen-hoofed and
golden-maned. They drew his
chariot over the sea, which became
smooth before him, while
dolphins and other monsters of
the deep gamboled about his
path. In his honor black and
white bulls, white boars, and rams
were sacrificed.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 41. Wedding of Poseidon and Amphitrite</span></p></div>

<p><b>52. The Lesser Divinities of</b>
<b>the Waters</b><a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> were:</p>

<p>1. <i>Triton</i>, the son of Neptune
and Amphitrite, trumpeter
of Ocean. By his blast on the
sea-shell he stirred or allayed the
waves.</p>

<p>2. <i>Proteus</i>, an attendant and,
according to certain traditions, a
son of Neptune. Like Nereus,
he was a little old man of the
sea. He possessed the prophetic
gift and the power of changing
his shape at will.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Harpies</i>, foul creatures,
with heads of maidens, bodies,
wings, and claws of birds, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>faces pale with hunger. They are the offspring of Thaumas, a
son of Pontus and G&aelig;a.</p>

<p>4. The uncanny offspring of Phorcys and Ceto,&mdash;children of
Pontus,&mdash;who rejoiced in the horrors of the sea:</p>

<p><i>a. The Gr&aelig;&aelig;</i>, three hoary witches, with one eye between them
which they used in turn.</p>

<p><i>b. The Gorgons</i>, whose glance was icy death.</p>

<p><i>c. The Sirens</i>, muses of the sea and of death, who by their
sweet singing enticed seafarers to destruction.</p>

<p><i>d. Scylla</i>, also destructive to mariners, a six-headed monster
whose lower limbs were serpents and ever-barking dogs.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 42. Triton carrying off a Nymph</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>5. <i>Atlas</i>, who stood in the far west, bearing on his shoulders the
vault of heaven. He was once regarded as a divinity of the sea, but
later as a mountain. He was the son of Iapetus and the father of
three classes of nymphs,&mdash;the Pleiads, the Hyads, and, according
to some stories, the Hesperids. The last-mentioned, assisted by
their mother Hesperis and a dragon, guarded the golden apples of
the tree that had sprung up to grace the wedding of Jove and Juno.
The daughters of Atlas were not themselves divinities of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>6. <i>The Water-Nymphs.</i> Beside the <i>Oceanids</i> and the <i>Nere&iuml;ds</i>,
who have already been mentioned, of most importance were the
<i>Naiads</i>, daughters of Jupiter. They presided over brooks and fountains.
Other lesser powers of the Ocean were Glaucus, Leucothea,
and Melicertes, of whom more is said in another section.</p>

<p>In the following statement of the difference between ancient
and modern conceptions of nature, the poet lends new charm to
the fabled rulers of the sea.</p>

<span class="ph4">THE ROMAN DIVINITIES</span></h3>


<p><b>53. Gods Common to Greece and Italy.</b> Of the deities already
mentioned, the following, although they were later identified with
certain Greek gods and goddesses<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> whose characteristics and
adventures they assumed, had developed an independent worship
in Italy: Jupiter (Zeus); Juno (Hera); Minerva (Athene); Diana
(Artemis); Mars (Ares); Venus (Aphrodite); Vulcanus, or Mulciber
(Heph&aelig;stus); Vesta (Hestia); Mercurius (Hermes); Neptunus
(Poseidon); Ceres (Demeter); Liber (Bacchus); Libera
(Persephone); Magna Mater, the great mother of the gods (Rhea,
Cybele); Orcus (Pluto, Hades); Tellus, the Earth (G&aelig;a).</p>

<p><b>54. Italian Gods.</b> There were also divinities always peculiar to
Roman mythology.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Of these the more important are:</p>

<p>1. <i>Saturn</i>, an ancient Italian deity (as his name indicates) of
seeds and sowing, the introducer of agriculture. Fanciful attempts
were made to identify him with the Grecian god Cronus; and it
was fabled that after his dethronement by Jupiter he fled to Italy,
where he reigned during the Golden Age. In memory of his
dominion, the feast of Saturnalia was held every year in the winter
season. Then all public business was suspended; declarations of
war and criminal executions were postponed; friends made presents
to one another; and even slaves were indulged with great
liberties. A feast was given them at which they sat at table while
their masters served, to show the natural equality of men, and
that all things belonged equally to all in the reign of Saturn.
The wife of Saturn was <i>Ops</i>, goddess of sowing and harvest (later
confounded with Rhea). Another Roman deity of earth was
<i>Consus</i>, whose name means "the keeper of the stores." He is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>god of the stored-up harvest; and his altar is said to have been discovered
underground by Romulus. It was in the Circus Maximus
and was uncovered only on the days of his festivals, the harvest
home of August and the granary feast of December. The underground
altar is a reminiscence of the ancient custom of storing corn
underground or at any rate of burying the sacrifices offered to deities
of the earth. The harvest festival was celebrated with horse races,
which, originating in a very simple way with the primitive farmers,
became in time the distinctive feature of the Circus Maximus.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 43. Bearded</span>
<span class="smcap">Janus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>2. <i>Janus</i>, whose name is derived from the Latin root which
means "going" and is connected with <i>janua</i>, a passage or door,
is the most distinctive and most important of
the native Italic deities. He is not only the
god of doors, or material openings, but more
truly of beginnings,&mdash;especially of good beginnings
which insure good endings. Hence
undoubtedly he is represented as facing both
ways; for the Romans very properly believed
that beginning and ending were of the same
piece, and that an undertaking ill begun
could not achieve success. His temple, or
covered passage, in the Forum had doors facing east and west for
the beginning and ending of the day; and between stood his two-faced
statue. In every home the morning prayer was addressed to
him; in every domestic enterprise his assistance was implored. He
was the god, also, of the opening year; hence his month, January,
on the first day of which words only of good omen were uttered,
and gifts were given (<i>strenae</i>, a name still preserved in the French
word for New Year's presents, <i>&eacute;trennes</i>), and, for good luck, some
stroke of work was bestowed on every undertaking planned for
the year. He was publicly invoked not only on New Year's day,
but on the first day of each month, by priests and people alike;
and in these prayers his name was mentioned even before that of
Jupiter. He is the god of civilization, and is sometimes called
Consivius, or the Sower.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Of course he was invoked when wars
were commenced. And during their progress the doors of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>temple stood always open. In peace they were closed; but they
were shut only once between the reign of Numa and that of
Augustus. It was natural that his worship should gradually absorb
that of Sol, the Sun, who opens the day and completes the year and
blesses with his rays the seeds that are sown; and such was the
case. But Janus and his wife Jana were not originally connected
even in name with Dianus (Sol, Apollo) and Diana (the moon).</p>

<p>3. <i>Quirinus</i>, a war-god, said to be no other than Romulus, the
founder of Rome, exalted after his death to a place among the
immortals.</p>

<p>4. <i>Bellona</i>, a war-goddess.</p>

<p>5. <i>Lucina</i>, the goddess who brings to light, hence the goddess
of childbirth: a title bestowed upon both Juno and Diana.</p>

<p>6. <i>Terminus</i>, the god of landmarks. His statue was a rude
stone or post, set in the ground to mark the boundaries of fields.</p>

<p>7. <i>Faunus</i>, the grandson of Saturn. He was worshiped as a
god of fields and shepherds and also of prophecy. His name in
the plural, Fauni, expressed a class of gamesome deities, like the
Satyrs of the Greeks. There was also a goddess called <i>Fauna</i>, or
<i>Bona Dea</i> (good goddess). To Maia, wife of Vulcan, this designation,
<i>Bona Dea</i>, was sometimes applied.</p>

<p>8. <i>Sylvanus</i>, presiding over forest-glades and plowed fields.</p>

<p>9. <i>Pales</i>, the goddess presiding over cattle and pastures. <i>Flora</i>,
the goddess of flowers. <i>Pomona</i>, presiding over fruit trees. <i>Vertumnus</i>,
the husband of Pomona, was guardian of fruit trees,
gardens, and vegetables.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pomona loves the orchard,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Liber loves the vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pales loves the straw-built shed<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>10. <i>The Penates</i>, gods who were supposed to attend to the
welfare and prosperity of the family. Their name is derived from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>Penus, the storehouse or inner chamber, which was sacred to
them. Every master of a family was the priest to the Penates of
his own house.</p>

<p>The <i>Lares</i>, or <i>Lars</i>, were also tutelary deities, but they differed
from the Penates since they were regarded as the deified spirits
of ancestors, who watched over and protected their descendants.
The Lares were more particularly divinities presiding over the
household or family; but there were also public Lares, or guardian
spirits of the city, Lares of the precincts, Lares of the fields, Lares
of the highways, and Lares of the sea. To the Penates, to the
domestic Lares (whose images were preserved in a private shrine),
and to the <i>Manes</i> (shades that
hovered over the place of
burial), the family prayers of
the Romans were addressed.
Other spirits, the <i>Lemures</i> and
<i>Larv&aelig;</i>, more nearly correspond
to our ghosts.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/image047.jpg" width="300" height="256" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 44. Genius Loci</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The Romans believed that
every man had his <i>Genius</i> and
every woman her <i>Juno</i>; that
is, a spirit who had given them
being and was regarded as
a protector through life. On
birthdays men made offerings to their Genius, women to their Juno.</p>

<p>11. Other Italian deities were the gods of the rivers, such as
<i>Father Tiber</i>, and the goddesses of the springs and brooks, such as
<i>Juturna</i>, whose pool in the Forum was sacred. This nymph was
also a goddess of healing and, according to later tradition, was
beloved by Jupiter. Earlier stories, however, make her the wife
of Janus and the mother of <i>Fontus</i>, the god of flowing waters,
who had an altar on the Janiculan hill and was worshiped at an
annual festival called the Fontinalia, when the wells were wreathed
with garlands. Held in especial honor were the <i>Camen&aelig;</i>, fountain-nymphs,
goddesses of prophecy and healing (later identified with
the Muses). The leader of them was <i>Carmenta</i>, who sang both the
future and the past. With her is sometimes associated the nymph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
<i>Egeria</i>, from whom the Roman king Numa is said to have received
instruction concerning the forms of worship which he introduced.</p>

<p>12. The Romans worshiped, also, <i>Sol</i>, the Sun; <i>Luna</i>, the
Moon; <i>Mater Matuta</i>, the Dawn; <i>Juventus</i>, Youth; <i>Fides</i>,
Honesty; <i>Feronia</i>, goddess of groves and freedmen; and a great
number of personified abstractions of conduct and experience,
such as Fortune and Health.</p>

<p>Many of these Latin divinities were derived from the earlier
cult and ritual of the Etruscan inhabitants of Italy.</p>

<span class="ph4">MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF HEAVEN</span></h3>


<p><b>55. Myths of Jupiter and Juno.</b> Not a few of the adventures
of Jupiter turn upon his love affairs. Among the immortals his
queen had rivals in his affection; for instance, Latona, a goddess
of darkness, daughter of the Titans C&oelig;us and Ph&oelig;be. This goddess
became, as we have already seen, the mother of Apollo and
Diana. The ire of Juno against
her was never appeased. In
consequence of it, numerous
trials were visited upon Latona,
some of which find a place
among the adventures of her
children.</p>

</div>

<p><b>56. Love Affairs of Jupiter.</b>
Not only with immortals but
with mortals were Jupiter's relations
sometimes of a dubious
character. His devotion to the
beautiful daughters of men involved
him in frequent altercations
with his justly jealous
spouse. Of his fondness for Dana&euml;, whom he approached in a
shower of gold, particulars are given in the story of her son Perseus;
of his love for Alcmene, the granddaughter of that Perseus,
we are informed in the myths of her son Hercules; and of his
attentions to Leda, whom he wooed in guise of a swan, we learn
in the accounts of their children Pollux and Helen. Other love
passages, upon which narratives depend, concern Io, Callisto,
Europa, Semele, &AElig;gina, and Antiope.</p>

IN THE FIFTH CENTURY B.C.</span>
</a></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p><b>57. Io</b><a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> was of divine ancestry. Her father was the river-god
Inachus, son of Oceanus. It is said that Juno one day, perceiving
the skies suddenly overcast, surmised that her husband had raised
a cloud to hide some escapade. She brushed away the darkness
and saw him on the banks of a glassy river with a beautiful heifer
standing near. Juno suspected, with reason, that the heifer's form
concealed some fair nymph of mortal mold. It was Io, whom
Jupiter, when he became aware of the approach of his wife, had
changed into that form.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image050.jpg" width="400" height="180" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 46. Hermes Kills Argus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The ox-eyed goddess joined her husband, noticed the heifer,
praised its beauty, and asked whose it was and of what herd.
Jupiter, to stop questions,
replied that it was a fresh
creation from the earth.
Juno begged it as a gift.
What could the king of
gods and men do? He
was loath to surrender his
sweetheart to his wife; yet
how refuse so trifling a
present as a heifer? He could not, without exciting suspicion,
and he therefore consented. The goddess delivered the heifer
to Argus, to be strictly watched.</p>

<p>Now Argus had a hundred eyes in his head, and never went
to sleep with more than two at a time, so that he kept watch of
Io constantly. He suffered her to graze through the day and at
night tied a rope round her neck. She would have stretched out
her arms to implore freedom of Argus, but that she had no arms
to stretch out and her voice was a bellow. She yearned in vain
to make herself known to her father. At length she bethought
herself of writing, and inscribed her name&mdash;it was a short one&mdash;with
her hoof on the sand. Inachus recognized it, and, discovering
that his daughter whom he had long sought in vain was hidden
under this disguise, mourned over her. While he thus lamented,
Argus, observing, drove her away and took his seat on a bank
from whence he could see in every direction.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 258px;">
<img src="images/image051.jpg" width="258" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 47. Io, Argus, and Mercury</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Jupiter, grieved by the sufferings of his mistress, sent Mercury
to dispatch Argus. Mercury took his sleep-producing wand and
presented himself on earth as a shepherd driving his flock. As
he strolled, he blew upon his syrinx or Pandean pipes. Argus
listened with delight. "Young man," said he, "come and take a
seat by me on this stone. There is no better place for your flock
to graze in than hereabouts, and here is a pleasant shade such as
shepherds love." Mercury sat down, talked, told stories till it
grew late, and played upon
his pipes his most soothing
strains, hoping to lull the
watchful eyes to sleep, but
in vain; for Argus still
contrived to keep some of
his eyes open, though he
shut the rest.</p>

<p>But among other stories,
Mercury told him how the instrument
on which he played
was invented. "There was
a certain nymph," said he,
"whose name was Syrinx,&mdash;much
beloved by the satyrs
and spirits of the wood. She
would have none of them,
but was a faithful worshiper
of Diana and followed the chase. Pan, meeting her one day,
wooed her with many compliments, likening her to Diana of the
silver bow. Without stopping to hear him she ran away. But on
the bank of the river he overtook her. She called for help on her
friends, the water-nymphs. They heard and consented. Pan threw
his arms around what he supposed to be the form of the nymph and
found he embraced only a tuft of reeds. As he breathed a sigh, the
air sounded through the reeds and produced a plaintive melody.
Whereupon the god, charmed with the novelty and with the
sweetness of the music, said, 'Thus, then, at least, you shall be
mine.' Taking some of the reeds of unequal lengths and placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
them together, side by side, he made an instrument and called it
Syrinx, in honor of the nymph." Before Mercury had finished his
story he saw the eyes of Argus all asleep. At once he slew him and
set Io free. The eyes of Argus Juno took and scattered as ornaments
on the tail of her peacock, where they remain to this day.</p>

<p>But the vengeance of Juno was not yet satiated. She sent a
gadfly to torment Io, who, in her flight, swam through the sea,
named after her, Ionian. Afterward, roaming over many lands,
she reached at last the banks of the Nile. Then Jupiter interceded
for her; and upon his engaging not to pay her any further attention,
Juno consented to restore her to her form.</p>

<p>In a poem dedicated to Leigh Hunt, by Keats, the following
allusion to the story of Pan and Syrinx occurs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So did he feel who pulled the boughs aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we might look into a forest wide, ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Telling us how fair trembling Syrinx fled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor nymph&mdash;poor Pan&mdash;how he did weep to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the reedy stream; a half-heard strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of sweet desolation, balmy pain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><b>58. Callisto</b> of Arcadia was another maiden who excited the
jealousy of Juno. Her the goddess changed into a bear. Often,
frightened by the dogs, Callisto, though lately a huntress, fled in
terror from the hunters. Often, too, she fled from the wild beasts,
forgetting that she was now a wild beast herself; and, bear as she
was, she feared the bears.</p>

<p>One day a youth espied her as he was hunting. She saw him
and recognized him as her son Arcas, grown to manhood. She
stopped and felt inclined to embrace him. He, alarmed, raised
his hunting spear and was on the point of transfixing her, but
Jupiter arrested the crime and, snatching away both of them,
placed them in the heavens as the Great and Little Bear.</p>

<p>Juno, enraged at seeing her rival so set in honor, hastened to
ancient Tethys and Oceanus and, complaining that she was supplanted
in Heaven, cried, "So do my punishments result&mdash;such
is the extent of my power! I forbade her to wear human form,&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and her hateful son are placed among the stars. Better
that she should have resumed her former shape, as I permitted Io
to do. Perhaps my husband means to take her to wife, and put
me away! But you, my foster parents, if you feel for me, and see
with displeasure this unworthy treatment of me, show it, I beseech
you, by forbidding this guilty couple from coming into your waters."
The powers of the Ocean assented, and consequently the two constellations
of the Great and Little Bear move round and round in
the neighborhood of the pole, but never sink, as do the other
stars, beneath the Ocean.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><b>59. Europa</b> was the daughter of Agenor, king of Ph&oelig;nicia,
son of the god Neptune. The story of Jupiter's love for her is
thus told by the idyllic poet, Moschus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To Europa, princess of Asia, once on a time, a sweet dream was sent by
Cypris.... Then she beheld two continents at strife for her sake, Asia and
the further shore, both in the shape of women. Of these one had the guise
of a stranger, the other of a lady of that land, and closer still she clung about
her maiden, and kept saying how she was her mother, and herself had nursed
Europa. But that other with mighty hands, and forcefully, kept haling the
maiden, nothing loth; declaring that, by the will of &aelig;gis-bearing Jupiter,
Europa was destined to be her prize.</p>

<p>But Europa leaped forth from her strown bed in terror, with beating heart,
in such clear vision had she beheld the dream.... And she said, "Ah! who
was the alien woman that I beheld in my sleep? How strange a longing for
her seized my heart, yea, and how graciously she herself did welcome me, and
regard me as it had been her own child! Ye blessed gods, I pray you, prosper
the fulfillment of the dream!"</p>

<p>Therewith she arose, and began to seek the dear maidens of her company,
girls of like age with herself, born in the same year, beloved of her heart, the
daughters of noble sires, with whom she was always wont to sport, when she
was arrayed for the dance, or when she would bathe her bright body at the
mouths of the rivers, or would gather fragrant lilies on the leas....</p>

<p>Now the girls, so soon as they were come to the flowering meadows, took great
delight in various sorts of flowers, whereof one would pluck sweet-breathed
narcissus, another the hyacinth, another the violet, a fourth the creeping
thyme; and on the ground there fell many petals of the meadows rich with
spring. Others, again, were emulously gathering the fragrant tresses of the
yellow crocus; but in the midst of them all the princess culled with her hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>the splendor of the crimson rose, and shone pre&euml;minent among them all like
the foam-born goddess among the Graces. Verily, she was not for long to set
her heart's delight upon the flowers.... For of a truth, the son of Cronus,
so soon as he beheld her, was troubled, and his heart was subdued by the
sudden shafts of Cypris, who alone can conquer even Jupiter. Therefore, both
to avoid the wrath of jealous Juno, and being eager to beguile the maiden's
tender heart, he concealed his godhead, and changed his shape, and became a
bull....</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/image052.jpg" width="500" height="238" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 48. Europa on the Bull</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>He came into the meadow, and his coming terrified not the maidens, nay,
within them all wakened desire to draw nigh the lovely bull, and to touch
him, and his heavenly fragrance
was scattered afar,
exceeding even the sweet
perfume of the meadows.
And he stood before the
feet of fair Europa, and
kept licking her neck,
and cast his spell over
the maiden. And she still
caressed him, and gently
with her hands she wiped
away the deep foam from his lips, and kissed the bull. Then he lowed so
gently, ye would think ye heard the Mygdonian flute uttering a dulcet sound.</p>

<p>He bowed himself before her feet, and bending back his neck, he gazed on
Europa, and showed her his broad back. Then she spake among her deep-tressed
maidens, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, dear playmates, maidens of like age with me, let us mount the bull
here and take our pastime, for, truly, he will bear us on his back, and carry all
of us! And how mild he is, and dear, and gentle to behold, and no whit like
other bulls! A mind as honest as a man's possesses him, and he lacks nothing
but speech."</p>

<p>So she spake, and smiling, she sat down on the back of the bull, and the
others were about to follow her. But the bull leaped up immediately, now he
had gotten her that he desired, and swiftly he sped to the deep. The maiden
turned, and called again and again to her dear playmates, stretching out her
hands, but they could not reach her. The strand he gained, and forward he
sped like a dolphin, faring with unwetted hooves over the wide waves. And
the sea, as he came, grew smooth, and the sea monsters gamboled around,
before the feet of Jupiter; and the dolphin rejoiced, and rising from the deeps,
he tumbled on the swell of the sea. The Nere&iuml;ds arose out of the salt water,
and all of them came on in orderly array, riding on the backs of sea beasts.
And himself, the thunderous shaker of the world, appeared above the sea, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
made smooth the wave, and guided his brother on the salt sea path, and round
him were gathered the Tritons, these hoarse trumpeters of the deep, blowing
from their long conchs a bridal melody.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Europa, riding on the back of the divine bull, with one hand
clasped the beast's great horn, and with the other caught up the purple fold
of her garment, lest it might trail and be wet in the hoar sea's infinite spray.
And her deep robe was swelled out by the winds, like the sail of a ship, and
lightly still did waft the maiden onward. But when she was now far off from
her own country, and neither sea-beat headland nor steep hill could now be
seen, but above, the air, and beneath, the limitless deep, timidly she looked
around, and uttered her voice, saying,&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image053.jpg" width="400" height="184" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 49. Nere&iuml;ds on Sea Beasts</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>"Whither bearest thou me, bull god? What art thou? How dost thou fare
on thy feet through the path of the sea beasts, nor fearest the sea? The sea
is a path meet for swift ships that traverse the brine, but bulls dread the salt
sea ways. What drink is sweet to thee, what food shalt thou find from the deep?
Nay, art thou then some god, for godlike are these deeds of thine." ...</p>

<p>So spake she, and the horned bull made answer to her again: "Take
courage, maiden, and dread not the swell of the deep. Behold, I am Jupiter,
even I, though, closely beheld, I wear the form of a bull, for I can put on the
semblance of what thing I will. But 'tis love of thee that has compelled me
to measure out so great a space of the salt sea, in a bull's shape. So Crete
shall presently receive thee, Crete that was mine own foster-mother, where thy
bridal chamber shall be."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p></div>

</div>

<p><b>60. Semele</b> was the daughter
of Cadmus, founder of Thebes.
She was descended, through
both parents, from the gods;
for her mother Harmonia was
daughter to Mars and the
laughter-loving Venus. To
Semele Jupiter had appeared,
and had paid court in unostentatious
manner and simple
guise. But Juno, to gratify her
resentment against this new
rival for her lord's affections,
contrived a plan for her destruction.
Assuming the form
of Bero&euml;, the aged nurse of
Semele, she insinuated doubts
whether it was indeed Jove
himself who came as a lover.
Heaving a sigh, she said, "I hope it will turn out so, but I can't
help being afraid. People are not always what they pretend to be.
If he is indeed Jove, make him give some proof of it. Ask him
to come arrayed in all his splendors, such as he wears in Heaven.
That will put the matter beyond a doubt." Semele was persuaded
to try the experiment. She asks a favor, without naming what it
is. Jove gives his promise, and confirms it with the irrevocable
oath, attesting the river Styx, terrible to the gods themselves.
Then she made known her request. The god would have stopped
her as she spake, but she was too quick for him. The words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>escaped, and he could neither unsay his promise nor her request.
In deep distress he left her and returned to the upper regions.
There he clothed himself in his splendors, not putting on all his
terrors, as when he overthrew the giants, but what is known among
the gods as his lesser panoply. With thunders and lightnings
he entered the chamber of Semele. Her mortal frame could not
endure the splendors of the immortal radiance. She was consumed
to ashes.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Her son was the god Bacchus.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Semele, in the
blissful seats of Heaven, whither she was transported by the sorrowful
Jove, has been represented as recounting thus the story of
her doom:</p>

<p><b>61. &AElig;gina.</b> The extent to which those who were concerned
only indirectly in Jupiter's love affairs might yet be involved in
the consequences of them is illustrated by the fortunes of &AElig;gina.
This maiden, the daughter of Asopus, a river-god, attracted the
attention of Jupiter, who straightway ran off with her. Now, on
the one hand, Sisyphus, king of Corinth, having witnessed the
intrigue, was indiscreet enough to disclose it. Forthwith the vengeance
of the king of gods and men fell upon him. He was condemned
to Hades and, attempting to escape thence, had resort
to a series of deceptions that resulted in his eternal punishment.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
On the other hand, the inhabitants of the island that had the misfortune
to bear &AElig;gina's name incurred the displeasure of Juno, who
devastated their land with a plague. The following account of this
calamity is placed in the mouth of &AElig;acus, king of the island:<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>"At the beginning the sky seemed to settle down upon the
earth and thick clouds shut in the heated air. For four months
together a deadly south wind prevailed. The disorder affected the
wells and springs. Thousands of snakes crept over the land and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>shed their poison in the fountains. The force of the disease was
first spent on the lower animals,&mdash;dogs, cattle, sheep, and birds.
The oxen fell in the midst of their work. The wool dropped from
the bleating sheep. The horse groaned at his stall and died an
inglorious death. Everything languished; dead bodies lay in the
roads, the fields, and the woods; the air was poisoned by them.
Next the disease attacked the country people, and then the dwellers
in the city. At first the cheek was flushed and the breath drawn
with difficulty. The tongue grew rough and swelled, and the dry
mouth stood open, with its veins enlarged, and gasped for the air.
Men could not bear the heat of their clothes or their beds, but
preferred to lie on the bare ground. Nor could the physicians
help, for the disease attacked them also. At last men learned to
look upon death as the only deliverer from disease. All restraint
laid aside, they crowded round the wells and fountains, and drank,
without quenching thirst, till they died. On all sides lay my people
strewn like over-ripened apples beneath the tree, or acorns under
the storm-shaken oak. You see yonder a temple on the height.
It is sacred to Jupiter. Often, while the priest made ready for
sacrifice, the victim fell, struck down by disease without waiting
for the blow. At length all reverence for sacred things was lost.
Bodies were thrown out unburied, wood was wanting for funeral
piles, men fought with one another for the possession of them.
Finally there were none left to mourn; sons and husbands, old
men and youths, perished alike unlamented.</p>

<p>"Standing before the altar, I raised my eyes to Heaven. 'O
Jupiter,' I said, 'if thou art indeed my father, give me back my
people, or take me also away!' At these words a clap of thunder
was heard. 'I accept the omen,' I cried. By chance there grew
by the place where I stood an oak with wide-spreading branches,
sacred to Jupiter. I observed on it a troop of ants busy with their
labor. Observing their numbers with admiration, I said, 'Give
me, O father, citizens as numerous as these, and replenish my
empty city.' The tree shook, and the branches rustled, though
no wind agitated them. Night came on. The tree stood before
me in my dreams, with its numerous branches all covered with
living, moving creatures, which, falling to the ground, appeared to
gain in size, and by and by to stand erect, and finally to assume
the human form. Then I awoke. My attention was caught by
the sound of many voices without. While I began to think I was
yet dreaming, Telamon, my son, throwing open the temple gates,
exclaimed, 'Father, approach, and behold things surpassing even
your hopes!' I went forth; I saw a multitude of men, such as I
had seen in my dream. While I gazed with wonder and delight,
they approached and, kneeling, hailed me as their king. I paid
my vows to Jove, and proceeded to allot the vacant city to the
new-born race. I called them Myrmidons from the ant (<i>myrmex</i>),
from which they sprang. They are a diligent and industrious race,
eager to gain, and tenacious of their gains."</p>

<p>The Myrmidons were the soldiers of Achilles, the grandson of
King &AElig;acus, in the Trojan War.</p>

<p><b>62. Antiope</b> was, according to the Odyssey, another daughter
of Asopus, therefore a sister of &AElig;gina. But later poets make
this darling of Jove daughter of Nycteus, king of Thebes. While
she was engaged in the M&aelig;nad dances, Jupiter as a satyr wooed
and won her. She bore him two sons, Amphion and Zethus, who,
being exposed at birth on Mount Cith&aelig;ron, grew up among the
shepherds, not knowing their parentage. After various adventures
Antiope fell into the hands of her uncle Lycus, the usurping king
of Thebes, who, egged on by his wife Dirce, treated her with
extreme cruelty. Finally, when doomed by Dirce to be dragged
to death behind a bull, Antiope found means to inform her children
of her kinship to them. As it happened, they had been
ordered to execute the cruel sentence upon their mother. But
with a band of their fellow herdsmen, they attacked and slew
Lycus instead, and, tying Dirce by the hair of her head to a bull,
let her perish by her own device.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>While among the herdsmen, <i>Amphion</i> had been the special care
of Mercury, who gave him a lyre and taught him to play upon it.
His brother Zethus had occupied himself in hunting and tending
the flocks. Amphion himself is one of the most famous of mythical
musicians. Having become king of Thebes, it is said that when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>he played on his lyre, stones moved of their own accord and took
their places in the wall with which he was fortifying the city.</p>

<p>The musician's life was, however, not all harmony and happiness.
Owing to the pride of his wife Niobe, daughter of King
Tantalus, there befell him and his house a crushing calamity,
which is narrated among the exploits of Apollo and Diana.</p>

<p><b>63. Jupiter, a Friend of Man.</b> The kindly interest evinced by
the Thunderer toward mortals is displayed in the story of Baucis
and Philemon. Once on a time Jupiter, in human shape, visited
the land of Phrygia, and with him Mercury, without his wings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p>They presented themselves as weary travelers at many a door,
seeking rest and shelter, but found all closed; for it was late, and
the inhospitable inhabitants would not rouse themselves to open
for their reception. At last a small thatched cottage received them,
where Baucis, a pious old dame, and her husband Philemon had
grown old together. Not ashamed of their poverty, they made it
endurable by moderate desires and kind dispositions. When the
two guests crossed the humble threshold and bowed their heads
to pass under the low door, the old man placed a seat, on which
Baucis, bustling and attentive, spread a cloth, and begged them to
sit down. Then she raked out the coals from the ashes, kindled a
fire, and prepared some pot-herbs and bacon for them. A beechen
bowl was filled with warm water, that their guests might wash.
While all was doing, they beguiled the time with conversation.</p>

<p>The old woman with trembling hand set the table. One leg was
shorter than the rest, but a piece of slate put under restored the
level. When it was steady she rubbed the table down with sweet-smelling
herbs. Upon it she set some of chaste Minerva's olives,
some cornel berries preserved in vinegar, and added radishes and
cheese, with eggs lightly cooked in the ashes. The meal was served
in earthen dishes; and an earthenware pitcher, with wooden cups,
stood beside them. When all was ready the stew, smoking hot,
was set on the table. Some wine, not of the oldest, was added,
and for dessert, apples and wild honey.</p>

<p>Now while the repast proceeded, the old folks were astonished
to see that the wine, as fast as it was poured out, renewed itself in
the pitcher of its own accord. Struck with terror, Baucis and
Philemon recognized their heavenly guests, fell on their knees,
and with clasped hands implored forgiveness for their poor entertainment.
There was an old goose, which they kept as the guardian
of their humble cottage, and they bethought them to make
this a sacrifice in honor of their guests. But the goose, too nimble
for the old folk, with the aid of feet and wings eluded their pursuit
and at last took shelter between the gods themselves. They
forbade it to be slain, and spoke in these words: "We are gods.
This inhospitable village shall pay the penalty of its impiety; you
alone shall go free from the chastisement. Quit your house and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
come with us to the top of yonder hill." They hastened to obey.
The country behind them was speedily sunk in a lake, only their
own house left standing. While they gazed with wonder at the
sight, that old house of theirs was changed. Columns took the
place of the corner posts, the thatch grew yellow and appeared a
gilded roof, the floors became marble, the doors were enriched
with carving and ornaments of gold. Then spoke Jupiter in benignant
accents: "Excellent old man, and woman worthy of such a
husband, speak, tell us your wishes. What favor have you to ask
of us?" Philemon took counsel with Baucis a few moments, then
declared to the gods their common wish. "We ask to be priests
and guardians of this thy temple, and that one and the same
hour may take us both from life." Their prayer was granted.
When they had attained a great age, as they stood one day before
the steps of the sacred edifice and were telling the story of the
place, Baucis saw Philemon begin to put forth leaves, and Philemon
saw Baucis changing in like manner. While still they exchanged
parting words, a leafy crown grew over their heads. "Farewell,
dear spouse," they said together, and at the same moment the
bark closed over their mouths. The Tyanean shepherd still shows
the two trees,&mdash;an oak and a linden, standing side by side.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The story of Baucis and Philemon has been imitated by Swift
in a burlesque style, the actors in the change being two wandering
saints, and the house being changed into a church, of which
Philemon is made the parson:</p>

<p><b>64. Juno's Best Gift.</b> What the queen of heaven deemed the
greatest blessing reserved for mortals is narrated in the beautiful
myth of Biton and Cleobis. One Cydippe, an ancient priestess
of the white-armed goddess, had desired to behold the famous
new statue of Hera at Argos. Her sons testified their affection
for their mother by yoking themselves, since no oxen were at
hand, to her chariot, and so dragging her through heat and dust
many a weary league till they reached the temple, where stood the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
gold and ivory masterwork of Polyclitus. With admiration the
devoted priestess and her pious sons were received by the populace
crowding round the statue. The priest officiating in the
solemn rites thought meet that so reverend a worshiper should
herself approach the goddess,&mdash;ay, should ask of Hera some
blessing on her faithful sons:</p>

weaving, and needlework. She was also a warlike divinity, but
favored only defensive warfare. With Mars' savage love of violence
and bloodshed she, therefore, had no sympathy. Athens,
her chosen seat, her own city, was awarded to her as the prize of
a peaceful contest with Neptune, who also aspired to it. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>reign of Cecrops, the first king of Athens, the two deities had
contended for the possession of the city. The gods decreed that
it should be awarded to the one who produced the gift most useful
to mortals. Neptune gave the horse; Minerva produced the olive.
The gods awarded the city to the goddess, and after her Greek
appellation, Athena, it was named.</p>

<p><b>66. Arachne.</b> In another contest, a mortal dared to come into
competition with the gray-eyed daughter of Jove. This was Arachne,
a maiden who had attained such skill in the arts of carding and
spinning, of weaving and embroidery, that the Nymphs themselves
would leave their groves and fountains to come and gaze upon her
work. It was not only beautiful when it was done, but beautiful
also in the doing. To watch her one would have said that Minerva
herself had taught her. But this she denied, and could not bear
to be thought a pupil even of a goddess. "Let Minerva try her
skill with mine," said she. "If beaten, I will pay the penalty."
Minerva heard this and was displeased. Assuming the form of
an old woman, she appeared to Arachne and kindly advised her
to challenge her fellow mortals if she would, but at once to ask
forgiveness of the goddess. Arachne bade the old dame to keep
her counsel for others. "I am not afraid of the goddess; let her
try her skill, if she dare venture." "She comes," said Minerva,
and dropping her disguise, stood confessed. The Nymphs bent
low in homage and all the bystanders paid reverence. Arachne
alone was unterrified. A sudden color dyed her cheek, and then
she grew pale; but she stood to her resolve and rushed on her
fate. They proceed to the contest. Each takes her station and
attaches the web to the beam. Then the slender shuttle is passed
in and out among the threads. The reed with its fine teeth strikes
up the woof into its place and compacts the web. Wool of Tyrian
dye is contrasted with that of other colors, shaded off into one
another so adroitly that the joining deceives the eye. And the
effect is like the bow whose long arch tinges the heavens, formed
by sunbeams reflected from the shower,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> in which, where the colors
meet they seem as one, but at a little distance from the point of
contact are wholly different.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>
<p>Minerva wove the scene of her contest with Neptune (Poseidon).
Twelve of the heavenly powers were represented, Jupiter, with
august gravity, sitting in the midst. Neptune, the ruler of the sea,
held his trident and appeared to have just smitten the earth, from
which a horse had leaped forth. The bright-eyed goddess depicted
herself with helmed head, her &aelig;gis covering her breast, as when
she had created the olive tree with its berries and its dark green
leaves.</p>

<p>So wonderful was the central circle of Minerva's web; and in
the four corners were represented incidents illustrating the displeasure
of the gods at such presumptuous mortals as had dared to
contend with them. These were meant as warnings from Minerva
to her rival to give up the contest before it was too late.</p>

<p>But Arachne did not yield. She filled her web with subjects
designedly chosen to exhibit the failings and errors of the gods.
One scene represented Leda caressing the swan; and another,
Dana&euml; and the golden shower. Still another depicted Europa
deceived by Jupiter under the disguise of a bull. Its appearance
was that of a real bull, so naturally was it wrought and so natural
the water in which it swam.</p>

<p>With such subjects Arachne filled her canvas, wonderfully well
done but strongly marking her presumption and impiety. Minerva
could not forbear to admire, yet was indignant at the insult. She
struck the web with her shuttle and rent it in pieces; then, touching
the forehead of Arachne, she made her realize her guilt. It
was more than mortal could bear; and forthwith Arachne hanged
herself. "Live, guilty woman," said Minerva, "but that thou
mayest preserve the memory of this lesson continue to hang, both
thou and thy descendants, to all future times." Then, sprinkling
her with the juices of aconite, the goddess transformed her into a
spider, forever spinning the thread by which she is suspended.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><b>67. Myths of Mars.</b> The relations of Mars to other deities
may be best illustrated by passages from the Iliad, which, generally
speaking, presents him in no very favorable light.</p>

<p><b>68. Mars and Diomede.</b> In the war of the Greeks and the
Trojans,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> the cause of the former was espoused by Minerva, of
the latter by Mars. Among the chieftains of the Greeks in a
certain battle, Diomede, son of Tydeus, was prominent. Now
when Mars, scourge of mortals, beheld noble Diomede, he made
straight at him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... And when they were come nigh in onset on one another, first Mars
thrust over the yoke and horses' reins with spear of bronze, eager to take away
his life. But the bright-eyed goddess Minerva with her hand seized the spear
and thrust it up over the car, to spend itself in vain. Next Diomede of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>loud war cry attacked with spear of bronze; and Minerva drave it home against
Mars' nethermost belly, where his taslets were girt about him. There smote
he him and wounded him, rending through his fair skin,&mdash;and plucked forth
the spear again. Then brazen Mars bellowed loud as nine thousand warriors
or ten thousand cry in battle as they join in strife and fray. Thereat trembling
gat hold of Ach&aelig;ans and Trojans for fear, so mightily bellowed Mars
insatiate of battle.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Even as gloomy mist appeareth from the clouds when after heat a stormy
wind ariseth, even so to Tydeus' son Diomede brazen Mars appeared amid
clouds, faring to wide Heaven. Swiftly
came he to the gods' dwelling, steep
Olympus, and sat beside Jupiter, son
of Cronus, with grief at heart, and
showed the immortal blood flowing
from the wound, and piteously spake
to him winged words: "Father Jupiter,
hast thou no indignation to behold
these violent deeds? For ever cruelly
suffer we gods by one another's devices,
in showing men grace. With
thee are we all at variance, because
thou didst beget that reckless maiden
and baleful, whose thought is ever
of iniquitous deeds. For all the other
gods that are in Olympus hearken to
thee, and we are subject every one;
only her thou chaste-nest not, neither
in deed nor word, but settest her on,
because this pestilent one is thine
own offspring. Now hath she urged
on Tydeus' son, even overweening
Diomede, to rage furiously against
the immortal gods. The Cyprian first
he wounded in close fight, in the wrist of her hand, and then assailed he me,
even me, with the might of a god. Howbeit my swift feet bare me away; else
had I long endured anguish there amid the grisly heaps of dead, or else had
lived strengthless from the smitings of the spear."</p>

<p>Then Jupiter the cloud-gatherer looked sternly at him, and said: "Nay, thou
renegade, sit not by me and whine. Most hateful to me art thou of all gods
that dwell in Olympus; thou ever lovest strife and wars and battles. Truly
thy mother's spirit is intolerable, unyielding, even Juno's; her can I scarce
rule with words. Therefore I deem that by her prompting thou art in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
plight. Yet will I no longer endure to see thee in anguish; mine offspring
art thou, and to me thy mother bare thee. But wert thou born of any other
god unto this violence, long ere this hadst thou been lower than the sons of
Heaven."</p>

<p>So spake he and bade P&aelig;an heal him. And P&aelig;an laid assuaging drugs
upon the wound, and healed him, seeing he was in no wise of mortal mold.
Even as fig juice maketh haste to thicken white milk, that is liquid but curdleth
speedily as a man stirreth, even so swiftly healed he impetuous Mars.
And Hebe bathed him and clothed him in gracious raiment, and he sate down
by Jupiter, son of Cronus, glorying in his might.</p>

<p>Then fared the twain back to the mansion of great Jupiter, even Juno and
Minerva, having stayed Mars, scourge of mortals, from his man-slaying.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p></div>

<p><b>69. Mars and Minerva.</b> It would seem that the insatiate son of
Juno should have learned by this sad experience to avoid measuring
arms with the &aelig;gis-bearing Minerva. But he renewed the contest
at a later period in the fortunes of the Trojan War:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... Jupiter knew what was coming as he sat upon Olympus, and his heart
within him laughed pleasantly when he beheld that strife of gods. Then no
longer stood they asunder, for Mars, piercer of shields, began the battle and
first made for Minerva with his bronze spear, and spake a taunting word:
"Wherefore, O dogfly, dost thou match gods with gods in strife, with stormy
daring, as thy great spirit moveth thee? Rememberest thou not how thou
movedst Diomede, Tydeus' son, to wound me, and thyself didst take a visible
spear and thrust it straight at me and pierce through my fair skin? Therefore
deem I now that thou shalt pay me for all that thou hast done."</p>

<p>Thus saying, he smote on the dread tasseled &aelig;gis that not even the lightning
of Jupiter can overcome&mdash;thereon smote blood-stained Mars with his
long spear. But she, giving back, grasped with stout hand a stone that lay
upon the plain, black, rugged, huge, which men of old time set to be the landmark
of a field; this hurled she, and smote impetuous Mars on the neck, and
unstrung his limbs. Seven roods he covered in his fall, and soiled his hair
with dust, and his armor rang upon him. And Minerva laughed, and spake to
him winged words exultingly: "Fool, not even yet hast thou learnt how far
better than thou I claim to be, that thus thou matchest thy might with mine.
Thus shalt thou satisfy thy mother's curses, who deviseth mischief against
thee in her wrath, for that thou hast left the Ach&aelig;ans and givest the proud
Trojans aid."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
<p>Thus having said, she turned from him her shining eyes. Him did Venus,
daughter of Jupiter, take by the hand and lead away, groaning continually, for
scarce gathered he his spirit back to him.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p></div>

<p><b>70. The Fortunes of Cadmus.</b> Toward mortals Mars could show
himself, on occasion, as vindictive as his fair foe, the unwearied
daughter of Jove. This fact not only Cadmus, who slew a serpent
sacred to Mars, but all the family of Cadmus found out to their cost.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/image059.jpg" width="300" height="255" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 54. Cadmus slaying the Dragon</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>When Europa was carried away by Jupiter in the guise of a bull,
her father Agenor commanded his son Cadmus to go in search of
her and not to return without her. Cadmus sought long and far;
then, not daring to return unsuccessful, consulted the oracle of
Apollo to know what country he should settle in. The oracle informed
him that he would find a cow in the field, should follow her
wherever she might wander, and where she stopped should build a
city and call it Thebes. Cadmus had hardly left the Castalian cave,
from which the oracle was delivered, when he saw a young cow
slowly walking before him. He followed her close, offering at the
same time his prayers to Ph&oelig;bus. The cow went on till she passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>the shallow channel of Cephissus and came out into the plain of
Panope. There she stood still. Cadmus gave thanks, and stooping
down kissed the foreign soil, then lifting his eyes, greeted the surrounding
mountains. Wishing to offer a sacrifice to his protecting
deity, Minerva, he sent his servants to seek pure water for a libation.
Near by there stood an ancient grove which had never been
profaned by the ax, in the midst of which was a cave thick covered
with the growth of bushes, its roof forming a low arch from
beneath which burst forth a fountain of purest water. But in the
cave lurked a serpent with crested head, and scales glittering like
gold; his eyes shone like fire; his body was swollen with venom;
he vibrated a triple tongue and showed a triple row of teeth. No
sooner had the Tyrians dipped their pitchers in the fountain and
the in-gushing waters had made a sound, than the monster, twisting
his scaly body in a huge coil, darted upon them and destroyed
some with his fangs, others in his folds, and others with his
poisonous breath.</p>

<p>Cadmus, having waited for the return of his men till midday,
went in search of them. When he entered the wood and saw their
lifeless bodies and the dragon with his bloody jaws, not knowing
that the serpent was sacred to Mars, scourge of mortals, he lifted
a huge stone and threw it with all his force at the monster. The
blow made no impression. Minerva, however, was present, unseen,
to aid her worshiper. Cadmus next threw his javelin, which penetrated
the serpent's scales and pierced through to his entrails.
The monster attempted to draw out the weapon with his mouth,
but broke it off, leaving the iron point rankling in his flesh. His
neck swelled with rage, bloody foam covered his jaws, and the
breath of his nostrils poisoned the air around. As he moved onward,
Cadmus retreated before him, holding his spear opposite to
the serpent's opened jaws. At last, watching his chance, the hero
thrust the spear at a moment when the animal's head thrown back
came against the trunk of a tree, and so succeeded in pinning him
to its side.</p>

<p>While Cadmus stood over his conquered foe, contemplating its
vast size, a voice was heard (from whence he knew not, but it was
Minerva's) commanding him to take the dragon's teeth and sow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
them in the earth. Scarce had he done so when the clods began
to move and the points of spears to appear above the surface.
Next, helmets with their nodding plumes came up; next, the
shoulders and breasts and limbs of men with weapons, and in time
a harvest of armed warriors. Cadmus prepared to encounter a new
enemy, but one of them said to him, "Meddle not with our civil
war." With that he who had spoken smote one of his earthborn
brothers with a sword, and he himself fell pierced with an arrow
from another. The latter fell victim to a fourth, and in like manner
the whole crowd dealt with each other till all but five fell slain.
These five joined with Cadmus in building his city, to which they
gave the name appointed.</p>

</div>

<p>As penance for the destruction of this sacred serpent, Cadmus
served Mars for a period of eight years. After he had been absolved
of his impiety,
Minerva set him over
the realm of Thebes,
and Jove gave him to
wife Harmonia, the
daughter of Venus
and Mars. The gods
left Olympus to honor
the occasion with their
presence; and Vulcan presented the bride with a necklace of surpassing
brilliancy, his own workmanship. Of this marriage were
born four daughters, Semele, Ino, Autono&euml;, and Agave, and one
son, Polydorus. But in spite of the atonement made by Cadmus, a
fatality hung over the family. The very necklace of Vulcan seemed
to catch the spirit of ill luck and convey a baleful influence to such
as wore it. Semele, Ino, Act&aelig;on the son of Autono&euml;, and Pentheus
the son of Agave, all perished by violence. Cadmus and
Harmonia quitted Thebes, grown odious to them, and emigrated to
the country of the Enchelians, who received them with honor and
made Cadmus their king. But the misfortunes of their children
still weighing upon their minds, Cadmus one day exclaimed, "If a
serpent's life is so dear to the gods, I would I were myself a serpent."
No sooner had he uttered the words than he began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
change his form. Harmonia, beholding it, prayed the gods to let
her share his fate. Both became serpents. It is said that, mindful
of their origin, they neither avoid the presence of man nor do
they injure any one. But the curse appears not to have passed
from their house until the sons of their great-great-grandson
&OElig;dipus had by fraternal strife ended themselves and the family.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><b>71. Myths of Vulcan.</b> The stories of Vulcan are few, although incidents
illustrating his character are sufficiently numerous. According
to an account already given, Vulcan, because of his lameness,
was cast out of Heaven by his mother Juno. The sea-goddesses
Eurynome and Thetis took him mercifully to themselves, and for
nine years cared for him, while he plied his trade and gained proficiency
in it. In order to revenge himself upon the mother who
had so despitefully used him, he fashioned in the depths of the
sea a throne of cunning device, which he sent to his mother. She,
gladly accepting the glorious gift, sat down upon it, to find out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>that straightway all manner of invisible chains and fetters wound
and clasped themselves about her so that she could not rise. The
assistance of the gods was of no avail to release her. Then Mars
sought to bring Vulcan to Heaven by force that he might undo his
trickery; but before the flames of the fire-god, the impetuous warrior
speedily retreated. One god, however, the jovial Bacchus, was
dear to the blacksmith. He drenched Vulcan with wine, conducted
him to Olympus, and by persuasion caused him to set the queen of
gods and men at liberty.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">FIG. 57. A Sacrifice to Apollo</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>That Vulcan was not permanently hostile to Juno is shown
by the services that on various occasions he rendered her. He
forged the shield of her favorite Achilles; and, at her instance, he
undertook a contest against
the river Xanthus. Homer<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
describes the burning of
elms and willow trees and
tamarisks, the parching of
the plains, the bubbling of
the waters, that signalized the
fight, and how the eels and
other fish were afflicted by
Vulcan till Xanthus in anguish
cried for quarter.</p>

<p><b>72. Myths of Apollo.</b> The
myths which cluster about the
name of Ph&oelig;bus Apollo illustrate, first, his birth and the wanderings
of his mother, Latona; secondly, his victory over darkness and winter;
thirdly, his gifts to man,&mdash;youth and vigor, the sunshine of
spring, and the vegetation of early summer; fourthly, his baleful
influence,&mdash;the sunstroke and drought of midsummer, the miasma
of autumn; fifthly, his life on earth, as friend and counselor of
mankind,&mdash;healer, soothsayer, and musician, prototype of manly
beauty, and lover of beautiful women.</p>

<p><b>73. The Wanderings of Latona.</b> Persecuted by the jealousy of
the white-armed Juno, Latona fled from land to land. At last, bearing
in her arms the infant progeny of Jove, she reached Lycia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>weary with her burden and parched with thirst. There the following
adventure ensued. By chance the persecuted goddess espied
in the bottom of the valley a pond of clear water, where the country
people were at work gathering willows and osiers. She approached
and kneeling on the bank would have slaked her thirst
in the cool stream, but the rustics forbade her. "Why do you
refuse me water?" said she. "Water is free to all. Yet I ask it of
you as a favor. I have no intention of washing my limbs in it,
weary though they be, but only of quenching my thirst. A draft
of water would be nectar to me, and I would own myself indebted
to you for life itself. Let these infants move your pity, who stretch
out their little arms as if to plead for me."</p>

<p>But the clowns persisted in their rudeness; they added jeers,
and threatened violence if she did not leave the place. They waded
into the pond and stirred up the mud with their feet, so as to
make the water unfit to drink. Enraged, the goddess no longer
supplicated the clowns, but lifting her hands to Heaven exclaimed,
"May they never quit that pool but pass their lives there!" And
it came to pass accordingly. They still live in the water, sometimes
totally submerged, then raising their heads above the surface or
swimming upon it; sometimes coming out upon the bank, but soon
leaping back again into the water. Their voices are harsh, their
throats bloated, their mouths distended by constant railing; their
necks have shrunk up and disappeared, and their heads are joined
to their bodies. Their backs are green, their disproportioned bellies
white. They dwell as frogs in the slimy pool.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p><b>74. Apollo, the Light Triumphant.</b> Soon after his birth the
sun-god spent a year among the Hyperboreans, whose shining land
has been already described.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> On his return, slaying with his golden
arrows the Python that had infested the slopes near Delphi, he
sang for the first time that song of victory which, as <i>the P&aelig;an</i>,
is still among all nations synonymous with jubilation, praise, and
thanksgiving. In his conflict with another monster of darkness
and winter, the god of the silver bow had the assistance of his
sister Diana. By their unerring fiery darts they subdued the giant
Tityus, who not only had obstructed the peaceful ways to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>oracle of Delphi, but had ventured to insult the mother of the twin
deities. They overthrew also the Aload&aelig;, Otus and Ephialtes, sons
of Iphimedia and Neptune. These monsters, the reputed sons of
Aloeus, represent, perhaps, the unregulated forces of vegetation;
they were renowned for their strength, stature, and courage. They
grew at the rate of three cubits in height and one in breadth
every year; and, when nine years of age, they attempted, by piling
Mount Ossa upon Olympus, and Mount Pelion on top, to scale
the skies and dethrone the immortals. It is reported that not
Apollo and Diana, but Jupiter himself with
his lightning slew them. They atoned for
their presumption in Hades, where, bound
by serpents to a pillar, they were tormented
by the perpetual hooting of a screech owl.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 58. Apollo with Hyacinthus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><b>75. Hyacinthus.</b> The fiery force of the
Far-darter was not felt by the monsters
of darkness alone. His friendship for the
young and the vigorous was frequently as
dangerous as it was dear to the objects of it.
He was, for instance, passionately fond of a
youth named Hyacinthus. The god of the
silver bow accompanied the lad in his sports,
carried the nets when he went fishing, led
the dogs when he went to hunt, followed
him in his excursions in the mountains, and
neglected for him both lyre and arrows. One
day they played a game of quoits; Apollo, heaving aloft the discus
with strength mingled with skill, sent it high and far. Hyacinthus,
excited with the sport and eager to make his throw, ran forward to
seize the missile; but it bounded from the earth and struck him
in the forehead. He fainted and fell. The god, as pale as himself,
raised him and tried all his art to stanch the wound and retain the
flitting life, but in vain. As when one has broken the stem of a
lily in the garden it hangs its head and turns its flowers to the
earth, so the head of the dying boy, as if too heavy for his neck,
fell over on his shoulder. "Thou diest, Hyacinth," spake Ph&oelig;bus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>"robbed of thy youth by me. Would that I could die for thee! But
since that may not be, my lyre shall celebrate thee, my song shall
tell thy fate, and thou shalt become a flower inscribed with my regret."
While the golden god spoke, the blood which had flowed
on the ground and stained the herbage ceased to be blood; and a
flower of hue more beautiful than the Tyrian sprang up, resembling
the lily, save that this is purple and that silvery white. Ph&oelig;bus
then, to confer still greater honor, marked the petals with his sorrow,
inscribing "Ai! ai!" upon them. The flower bears the name
of Hyacinthus, and with returning spring revives the memory of
his fate.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>It was said that Zephyrus (the west wind), who was also fond
of Hyacinthus and jealous of his preference of Apollo, blew the
quoit out of its course to make it strike Hyacinthus.</p>

<p>While this youth met his death by accident, another of Apollo's
favorites, his own son, brought death upon himself by presumption.
The story is as follows:</p>

<p><b>76. Pha&euml;thon</b>[2] was the son of Apollo and the nymph Clymene.
One day Epaphus, the son of Jupiter and Io,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> scoffed at the idea
of Pha&euml;thon's being the son of a god. Pha&euml;thon complained of
the insult to his mother Clymene. She sent him to Ph&oelig;bus to ask
for himself whether he had not been truly informed concerning
his parentage. Gladly Pha&euml;thon traveled toward the regions of
sunrise and gained at last the palace of the Sun. He approached
his father's presence, but stopped at a distance, for the light was
more than he could bear. Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, arrayed in purple, sat
on a throne that glittered with diamonds. Beside him stood the
Day, the Month, the Year, the Hours, and the Seasons. Surrounded
by these attendants, the Sun beheld the youth dazzled
with the novelty and splendor of the scene, and inquired the purpose
of his errand. The youth replied, "Oh, light of the boundless
world, Ph&oelig;bus, my father&mdash;if thou dost yield me that name&mdash;give
me some proof, I beseech thee, by which I may be known
as thine!" He ceased. His father, laying aside the beams that
shone around his head, bade him approach, embraced him, owned
him for his son, and swore by the river Styx<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> that whatever proof
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>he might ask should be granted. Pha&euml;thon immediately asked to
be permitted for one day to drive the chariot of the sun. The
father repented of his promise and tried to dissuade the boy by
telling him the perils of the undertaking. "None but myself," he
said, "may drive the flaming car of day. Not even Jupiter, whose
terrible right arm hurls the thunderbolts. The first part of the way
is steep and such as the horses when fresh in the morning can
hardly climb; the middle is high up in the heavens, whence I
myself can scarcely, without alarm, look down and behold the earth
and sea stretched beneath me. The last part of the road descends
rapidly and requires most careful driving. Tethys, who is waiting
to receive me, often trembles for me lest I should fall headlong.
Add to this that the heaven is all the time turning round and carrying
the stars with it. Couldst thou keep thy course while the sphere
revolved beneath thee? The road, also, is through the midst of
frightful monsters. Thou must pass by the horns of the Bull, in
front of the Archer, and near the Lion's jaws, and where the
Scorpion stretches its arms in one direction and the Crab in
another. Nor wilt thou find it easy to guide those horses, with
their breasts full of fire that they breathe forth from their mouths
and nostrils. Beware, my son, lest I be the donor of a fatal gift;
recall the request while yet thou canst." He ended; but the youth
rejected admonition and held to his demand. So, having resisted
as long as he might, Ph&oelig;bus at last led the way to where stood
the lofty chariot.</p>

<p>It was of gold, the gift of Vulcan,&mdash;the axle of gold, the pole
and wheels of gold, the spokes of silver. Along the seat were rows
of chrysolites and diamonds, reflecting the brightness of the sun.
While the daring youth gazed in admiration, the early Dawn threw
open the purple doors of the east and showed the pathway strewn
with roses. The stars withdrew, marshaled by the Daystar, which
last of all retired also. The father, when he saw the earth beginning
to glow and the Moon preparing to retire, ordered the Hours to
harness up the horses. They led forth from the lofty stalls the
steeds full fed with ambrosia, and attached the reins. Then the
father, smearing the face of his son with a powerful unguent, made
him capable of enduring the brightness of the flame. He set the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
rays on the lad's head, and, with a foreboding sigh, told him to
spare the whip and hold tight the reins; not to take the straight
road between the five circles, but to turn off to the left; to keep
within the limit of the middle zone and avoid the northern and the
southern alike; finally, to keep in the well-worn ruts and to drive
neither too high nor too low, for the middle course was safest
and best.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Forthwith the agile youth sprang into the chariot, stood erect,
and grasped the reins with delight, pouring out thanks to his
reluctant parent. But the steeds soon perceived that the load they
drew was lighter than usual; and as a ship without ballast is tossed
hither and thither on the sea, the chariot, without its accustomed
weight, was dashed about as if empty. The horses rushed headlong
and left the traveled road. Then, for the first time, the Great and
Little Bears were scorched with heat, and would fain, if it were
possible, have plunged into the water; and the Serpent which lies
coiled round the north pole, torpid and harmless, grew warm, and
with warmth felt its rage revive. Bo&ouml;tes, they say, fled away,
though encumbered with his plow and unused to rapid motion.</p>

<p>When hapless Pha&euml;thon looked down upon the earth, now spreading
in vast extent beneath him, he grew pale, and his knees shook
with terror. He lost his self-command and knew not whether to
draw tight the reins or throw them loose; he forgot the names of
the horses. But when he beheld the monstrous forms scattered
over the surface of heaven,&mdash;the Scorpion extending two great
arms, his tail, and his crooked claws over the space of two signs
of the zodiac,&mdash;when the boy beheld him, reeking with poison
and menacing with fangs, his courage failed, and the reins fell
from his hands. The horses, unrestrained, went off into unknown
regions of the sky in among the stars, hurling the chariot over
pathless places, now up in high heaven, now down almost to the
earth. The moon saw with astonishment her brother's chariot
running beneath her own. The clouds began to smoke. The
forest-clad mountains burned,&mdash;Athos and Taurus and Tmolus
and &OElig;te; Ida, once celebrated for fountains; the Muses' mountain
Helicon, and H&aelig;mus; &AElig;tna, with fires within and without, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>Parnassus, with his two peaks, and Rhodope, forced at last to part
with his snowy crown. Her cold climate was no protection to
Scythia; Caucasus burned, and Ossa and Pindus, and, greater
than both, Olympus,&mdash;the Alps high in air, and the Apennines
crowned with clouds.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 59. The Fall of Pha&euml;thon</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Pha&euml;thon beheld the world on fire and felt the heat intolerable.
Then, too, it is said, the people of &AElig;thiopia became black because
the blood was called by the heat so suddenly to the surface; and
the Libyan desert was dried up to the condition in which it remains
to this day. The Nymphs of the fountains, with disheveled hair,
mourned their waters, nor were the rivers safe beneath their banks;
Tana&iuml;s smoked, and Ca&iuml;cus, Xanthus, and M&aelig;ander; Babylonian
Euphrates and Ganges, Tagus, with golden sands, and Cay&#x0308;ster,
where the swans resort. Nile fled away and hid his head in the
desert, and there it still remains concealed. Where he used to discharge
his waters through seven mouths into the sea, seven dry
channels alone remained. The earth cracked open, and through
the chinks light broke into Tartarus and frightened the king of
shadows and his queen. The sea shrank up. Even Nereus and his
wife Doris with the Nere&iuml;ds, their daughters, sought the deepest
caves for refuge. Thrice Neptune essayed to raise his head above
the surface and thrice was driven back by the heat. Earth, surrounded
as she was by waters, yet with head and shoulders bare,
screening her face with her hand, looked up to heaven, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
husky voice prayed Jupiter, if it were his will that she should
perish by fire, to end her agony at once by his thunderbolts, or
else to consider his own Heaven, how both the poles were smoking
that sustained his palace, and that all must fall if they were
destroyed.</p>

<p>Earth, overcome with heat and thirst, could say no more. Then
Jupiter, calling the gods to witness that all was lost unless some
speedy remedy were applied, thundered, brandished a lightning
bolt in his right hand, launched it against the charioteer, and struck
him at the same moment from his seat and from existence.
Pha&euml;thon, with his hair on fire, fell headlong, like a shooting star
which marks the heavens with its brightness as it falls, and Eridanus,
the great river, received him and cooled his burning frame.
His sisters, the Heliades, as they lamented his fate, were turned
into poplar trees on the banks of the river; and their tears, which
continued to flow, became amber as they dropped into the stream.
The Italian Naiads reared a tomb for him and inscribed these
words upon the stone:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Driver of Ph&oelig;bus' chariot, Pha&euml;thon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck by Jove's thunder, rests beneath this stone.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet was it much so nobly to aspire.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><b>77. The Plague sent upon the Greeks before Troy.</b> It was not,
however, only by accident, or by the ill-advised action of those
whom he loved, that Apollo's gifts of light and heat were turned
into misfortunes. Mortals who offended him were leveled by the
cruel sunstroke, by arrows of malarial venom, of manifold sickness
and death.</p>

<p>When the host of the Ach&aelig;ans was encamped before Troy, the
king of men, Atrides, unjustly declined to restore his captive,
Chryse&iuml;s of the fair cheeks, to her father Chryses, the priest of
far-darting Apollo. Then the aged Chryses went apart and prayed
aloud, "Hear me, god of the silver bow, ... let the Danaans pay
by thine arrows for my tears!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>So spake he in prayer; and Ph&oelig;bus Apollo heard him, and came down
from the peaks of Olympus wroth at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow
and covered quiver. And the arrows clanged upon his shoulders in his wrath,
as the god moved; and he descended like to night. Then he sate him aloof
from the ships, and let an arrow fly; and there was heard a dread clanging of
the silver bow. First did he assail the mules and fleet dogs, but afterward,
aiming at the men his piercing dart, he smote; and the pyres of the dead
burnt continually in multitude. Nor until Agamemnon had sent back his
winsome captive to her father did Apollo remove from the Danaans the loathsome
pestilence.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p></div>

<p><b>78. The Punishment of Niobe</b> is another illustration of the swift
and awful vengeance of Apollo, and also of his sister Diana. This
Niobe was the daughter of a certain Tantalus, king of Phrygia,
who had been received at the table of the gods by his father
Jupiter. But there was a strain of ingratitude and conceit in both
father and daughter. The father not only betrayed the secrets of
the gods, but, to ridicule their reputed omniscience, attempted at
a banquet to deceive them into eating the roasted flesh of his own
son Pelops. The gods were not deceived. Pelops was restored
to life,&mdash;Tantalus consigned to Tartarus. The daughter Niobe,
although she owed her happy marriage with Jupiter's son Amphion,
and her seven stalwart sons and seven blooming daughters, to the
favor of the gods and of Latona in particular, boasted of her birth,
her marriage, and her offspring, bragged of her superiority to
Latona, and, on one occasion, scoffed at the annual celebration in
honor of the goddess and her two children. Surveying the people
of Thebes with haughty glance, she said, "What folly to prefer
beings whom you have never seen to those who stand before your
eyes! Will you prefer to me this Latona, the Titan's daughter,
with her two children? I have seven times as many. Were I to
lose some of my children, I should hardly be left as poor as Latona
with her two only. Put off the laurel from your brows,&mdash;have
done with this worship!" The people left the sacred services
uncompleted.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 318px;">
<img src="images/image065.jpg" width="318" height="500" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 60. A Son of Niobe</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The goddess was indignant. On the Cynthian mountain top
she thus addressed her son and daughter: "My children, I who
have been so proud of you both and have been used to hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>myself second to none of the goddesses except Juno alone, begin
now to doubt whether I am indeed a goddess. I shall be deprived
of my worship altogether unless you protect me." She was proceeding
in this strain, but Apollo interrupted her. "Say no more,"
said he; "speech only delays punishment." So said Diana also.
Darting through the air, veiled in clouds, they alighted on the
towers of the city. Spread out
before the gates was a broad
plain where the youth of the city
pursued their warlike sports.
The sons of Niobe were there
with the rest,&mdash;some mounted
on spirited horses richly caparisoned,
some driving gay chariots.
Ismenos, the first-born,
as he guided his foaming steeds
was struck by an arrow from
above. "Ah me!" he cried,&mdash;dropped
the reins and fell
lifeless. Another, hearing the
sound of the bow, gave the rein
to his horses and attempted to
escape. The inevitable arrow
overtook him as he fled. Two
others, younger, stood wrestling
breast to breast: one arrow
pierced them both. Alphenor,
an elder brother, hastened to
the spot to render assistance, but fell in the act of brotherly duty.
One only was left, Ilioneus. "Spare me, ye gods!" he cried,
addressing all of them, in his ignorance that all needed not his
supplication; and Apollo would have spared him, but the arrow
had already left the string, and it was too late.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig 61. The Children of Niobe</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>When Niobe was acquainted with what had taken place, she
was indignant that the gods had dared, and amazed that they had
been able to do it. Her husband Amphion, overwhelmed with
the blow, destroyed himself. But the mother knelt over the lifeless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
bodies and kissed them. Raising
her pallid arms to heaven, "Cruel
Latona," said she, "satiate thy hard
heart while I follow to the grave
my seven sons. Yet where is thy
triumph? Bereaved as I am, I am
still richer than thou, my conqueror."
Scarce had she spoken, when the
bow sounded and struck terror into
all hearts except Niobe's alone. She
was brave from excess of grief. Her
daughters stood in garments of
mourning over the biers of their
dead brothers. One after another
they fell, struck by arrows, beside
the corpses that they were bewailing.
Only one remained, whom the
mother held clasped in her arms
and covered, as it were, with her
whole body. "Spare me one and
that the youngest! Oh, spare me
one of so many!" she cried; and
while she spoke, that one fell dead.
Desolate she sat among sons, daughters,
husband, all dead, and seemed
torpid with grief. The breeze moved
not her hair, no color was on her
cheek, her eyes glared fixed and
immovable, there was no sign of
life about her. Her very tongue
cleaved to the roof of her mouth
and her veins ceased to convey the
tide of life. Her neck bent not,
her arms made no gesture, her foot
no step. She was changed to stone,
within and without. Yet tears continued
to flow; and borne on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
whirlwind to her native mountain, she still remains, a mass of
rock from which a trickling stream flows, the tribute of her never-ending
grief.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p><b>79. The Lamentation for Linus.</b> How the people of Argos fell
under the displeasure of Apollo is told in the story of Linus,
a beautiful son of Apollo and Psamathe. In fear of her father
the king, Psamathe exposed the child on the mountains where,
brought up by shepherds among the lambs, he was in tender youth
torn to pieces by dogs. Meanwhile, Psamathe herself was driven
from her father's home; wherefore Apollo sent against the land
of the Argives a monster that for a season destroyed the children,
but at last was slain by a noble youth named Cor&oelig;bus. To
appease the wrathful deity, a shrine was erected midway between
Argos and Delphi; and every year Linus and his mother were
bewailed in melancholy lays by the mothers and children of Argos,
especially by such as had lost by death their own beloved. The
fate of Linus, like that of Hyacinthus and others who succumb
in the springtime of life under the excessive love of some shining
deity,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> typifies the sudden withering of herbs and flowers
and of animal life,&mdash;the calves and lambs, young children too,
under the fierce shafts of summer. The very name of Linus is
taken from the refrain <i>ai-linon</i>, or "woe is me," of the lament
anciently sung by the country people when thus afflicted by the
unhealthy heats, because of which the crops fail and the dogs go
mad and tear the little lambs to pieces. In the Iliad there is a
beautiful picture which shows us that the song was not reserved
completely for the dog days. It is of a vineyard teeming plenteously
with clusters:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>And there was a pathway through it by which the vintagers might go. And
maidens and striplings in childish glee bare the sweet fruit in plaited baskets.
And in the midst of them a boy made pleasant music on a clear-toned viol, and
sang thereto a sweet Linos-song with delicate voice; while the rest with feet
falling together kept time with the music and song.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p></div>

<p><b>80. &AElig;sculapius.</b> The Thessalian princess Coronis (or the
Messenian, Arsino&euml;) bore to Apollo a child who was named
&AElig;sculapius. On his mother's death
the infant was intrusted to the charge
of Chiron, most famous of the Centaurs,
himself instructed by Apollo and
Diana in hunting, medicine, music, and
the art of prophecy. When the sage
returned to his home bearing the infant,
his daughter Ocyrrho&euml; came forth to
meet him, and at sight of the child
burst into a prophetic strain, foretelling,
the glory that he should achieve.
&AElig;sculapius, when grown up, became a
renowned physician; in one instance he
even succeeded in restoring the dead to
life. Pluto resented this, and, at his
request, Jupiter struck the bold physician
with lightning and killed him, but
after his death received him into the
number of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

at the destruction of this son,
wreaked his vengeance on the innocent workmen who had made
the thunderbolt. These were the Cyclopes, who had their workshop
under Mount &AElig;tna, from which the smoke and flames of
their furnaces are constantly issuing. Apollo shot his arrows at
the Cyclopes, a deed which so incensed Jupiter that he condemned
him to serve a mortal for the space of one year. Accordingly,
Apollo went into the service of Admetus, king of Thessaly, and
pastured his flocks for him on the verdant banks of the river

happy in the possession of
Alcestis. But Admetus falling
ill and being near to
death, Apollo prevailed on
the Fates to spare him on
condition that some one
should consent to die in his
stead. Admetus, in his joy at
this reprieve, thought little
of the ransom, and, perhaps
remembering the declarations
of attachment which
he had often heard from his courtiers and dependents, fancied that
it would be easy to find a substitute. But it was not so. Brave
warriors, who would willingly have periled their lives for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>prince, shrunk from the thought of dying for him on the bed of
sickness; and old servants who had experienced his bounty and
that of his house from their childhood up were not willing to lay
down the scanty remnant of their days to show their gratitude.
Men asked, "Why does not one of his parents do it? They cannot
in the course of nature live much longer, and who can feel like
them the call to rescue the life they gave from an untimely end?"
But the parents, distressed though they were at the thought of
losing him, shrunk from the call. Then Alcestis, with a generous
self-devotion, proffered herself as the substitute. Admetus, fond
as he was of life, would not have submitted to receive it at such
a cost; but there was no remedy. The condition imposed by the
Fates had been met, and the decree was irrevocable. As Admetus
revived, Alcestis sickened, rapidly sank, and died.</p>

<p>Just after the funeral procession had left the palace, Hercules,
the son of Jupiter and Alcmena, arrived. He, to whom no labor
was too arduous, resolved to attempt her rescue. Said he:</p>

<p>"Admetus," said he, "take and keep this woman, my captive, till
I come thy way again." But Admetus would admit no woman into

</div>

<p><b>84. Apollo, the Musician.</b> Not only in Arcadia, Laconia, and
Thessaly did Apollo care as a herdsman for the cattle of a mortal
master; in Mount Ida, too, by the
order of Jupiter he herded for a year
the "shambling, crook-horned kine" of
King Laomedon, and, playing on the
lyre, aided Neptune to build the walls
of Troy, just as Amphion, in his turn,
had aided in the building of Thebes.
Apollo's life as herdsman was spent in
establishing wise laws and customs, in
musical contests on the flute and the
lyre, or in passages of love with nymphs
and maidens of mortal mold.</p>

<p><b>85. Apollo, Pan, and Midas.</b><a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> It is
said that on a certain occasion Pan had
the temerity to compare his music with
that of Apollo and to challenge the god
of the lyre to a trial of skill. The challenge
was accepted, and Tmolus, the
mountain-god, was chosen umpire. The
senior took his seat and cleared away
the trees from his ears to listen. At a
given signal Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody
gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower Midas,
who happened to be present. Then Tmolus turned his head toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>the sun-god, and all his trees turned with him. Apollo rose, his brow
wreathed with Parnassian laurel, while his robe of Tyrian purple
swept the ground. In his left hand he held the lyre and with his
right hand struck the strings. Tmolus at once awarded the victory
to the lyric god, and all but Midas acquiesced in the judgment. He
dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo promptly
transformed his depraved pair of ears into those of an ass.</p>

<p>King Midas tried to hide his misfortune under an ample turban.
But his hair-dresser found it too much for his discretion to keep
such a secret; he dug a hole in the ground and, stooping down,
whispered the story, and covered it up. But a thick bed of reeds
springing up in the meadow began whispering the story, and has
continued to do so from that day to this, every time a breeze
passes over the place.</p>

<p><b>86. Shelley's Hymn of Pan.</b> In the following verses Pan taunts
Apollo as he might have done when Midas was sitting contentedly by:</p>

<p><b>87. Marsyas</b> also was unfortunate enough to underrate Apollo's
musical ability. It seems that the flute, an invention of Minerva's,
had been thrown away by that goddess because Cupid laughed at
the grimaces which she made while playing it. Marsyas found the
instrument, blew upon it, and elicited such ravishing sounds that
he was tempted to challenge Apollo himself to a musical contest.
The god, of course, triumphed, and he punished Marsyas by flaying
him alive.</p>

<p><b>88. The Loves of Apollo.</b> Beside Psamathe of Argos, Coronis
of Thessaly, and the nymph Clymene, who have been already mentioned,
Apollo loved the muse Calliope, who bore him Orpheus,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
and the nymph Cyrene, whose son was Arist&aelig;us.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Of his relations
with other maidens the following myths exist.</p>

<p><b>89. Daphne.</b><a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The lord of the silver bow was not always prosperous
in his wooing. His first love, which, by the way, owed its
origin to the malice of Cupid, was specially unfortunate. It
appears that Apollo, seeing the boy playing with his bow and
arrows, had tauntingly advised him to leave warlike weapons for
hands worthy of them and content himself with the torch of love.
Whereupon the son of Venus had rejoined, "Thine arrows may
strike all things else, Apollo, but mine shall strike thee."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 273px;">

<div class="caption"><p>APOLLO AND DAPHNE</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, he took his stand on a rock of Parnassus, and drew
from his quiver two arrows of different workmanship,&mdash;one to
excite love, the other to repel it. The former was of gold and
sharp pointed, the latter blunt and tipped with lead. With the
leaden shaft he struck the nymph Daphne, the daughter of the river-god
Pene&uuml;s, and with the golden one Apollo, through the heart.
Forthwith the god was seized with love for the maiden, but she,
more than ever, abhorred the thought of loving. Her delight was
in woodland sports and in the spoils of the chase. Spurning all
lovers, she prayed her father that she might remain always unmarried,
like Diana. He consented, but, at the same time, warned
her that her beauty would defeat her purpose. It was the face of
this huntress maiden that Apollo saw. He saw
the charming disorder of her hair, and would
have arranged it; he saw her eyes bright as
stars; he saw her lips, and was not satisfied
with only seeing them. He longed for Daphne.
He followed her; she fled swifter than the
wind, nor delayed a moment at his entreaties.
"Stay," said he, "daughter of Pene&uuml;s; I am
not a foe. It is for love I pursue thee. I am no
clown, no rude peasant. Jupiter is my father.
I am lord of Delphi and Tenedos. I know all
things, present and future. I am the god of
song and the lyre. My arrows fly true to the
mark; but alas! an arrow more fatal than mine
has pierced my heart! I am the god of medicine
and know the virtues of all healing plants.
Alas! I suffer a malady that no balm can cure."</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 67. Daphne</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The nymph continues her flight and leaves
his plea half-uttered. But even as she flies she
charms him. The wind catches her garments,
and her unbound hair streams loose behind her. The god, sped by
Cupid, gains upon her in the race. His panting breath blows upon
her hair. Her strength begins to fail, and, ready to sink, she calls
upon her father, the river-god: "Help me, Pene&uuml;s! open the earth
to inclose me, or change my form, which has brought me into
this danger!" Scarcely had she spoken when a stiffness seized
her limbs; and little by little she took on the appearance of a
laurel tree. Apollo embraced the branches and lavished kisses on
the wood. The branches shrank from his lips. "Since thou canst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
not be my wife," said he, "thou shalt assuredly be my tree. I will
wear thee for my crown. I will decorate with thee my harp and my
quiver. When the Roman conquerors conduct the triumphal pomp
to the Capitol, thou shalt be woven into wreaths for their brows.
And, as eternal youth is mine, thou also shalt be always green, and
thy leaf know no decay." The laurel tree bowed its head in grateful
acknowledgment.</p>

amply justifies the following citation:</p>

<p>saying that she knew how sweet it might be forever with a god
to aid suffering men and women and "gild the face that from its

She was a water-nymph and in love with Apollo, who made her

ground with her unbound tresses streaming over her shoulders.
Nine days she sat, and tasted neither food nor drink,&mdash;her own
tears and the chilly dew her only sustenance. She gazed on the sun
when he rose; and as he passed through his daily course to his setting,
she saw no other object,&mdash;her eyes fixed constantly on him.
At last, they say, her limbs took root in the ground and her face

<p><b>92. Myths of Diana.</b> In company with her
radiant brother, we find Diana subduing Tityus
and the Python and assisting in the punishment
of Niobe. The speedy transformation of
Daphne has been attributed to this goddess, the
champion of maidenhood. According to some,
it was she, too, that changed Callisto into a bear,
when for love of Jupiter that nymph deserted
the huntress-band. Numerous are the myths
that celebrate the severity of the goddess of the
unerring bow toward those who offended her.
How she served Agamemnon for slaying one
of her hinds is told in the story of Troy;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> how
she punished &OElig;neus for omitting a sacrifice to
her is narrated in the episode of the Calydonian hunt.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Similar
attributes of the goddess are exemplified in the myths of Arethusa,
Act&aelig;on, and Orion. It is only when she is identified with Selene,
the peaceful moonlight, that we perceive a softer side of character,
such as that displayed in her relations with Endymion.</p>

<p><b>93. The Flight of Arethusa.</b><a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> A woodland nymph of Elis was
this Arethusa; she delighted not in her comeliness, but in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>joys of the chase. One day, returning from the wood heated with
exercise, she descended to a stream silently flowing, so clear that
you might count the pebbles on the bottom. She laid aside her
garments; but while she sported in the water, she heard an indistinct
murmur rising as out of the depths of the stream. She made
haste to reach the nearest bank. A voice followed her, "Why
flyest thou, Arethusa? Alphe&uuml;s am I, the god of this stream."
The nymph ran, the god pursued. Arethusa,
at last exhausted, cried for help to Diana, who,
hearing, wrapped her votary in a thick cloud.
Perplexed, the river-god still sought the trembling
maiden. But a cold sweat came over her.
In less time than it takes to tell, she had become
a fountain. Alphe&uuml;s attempted then to mingle
his stream with hers. But the Cynthian queen
cleft the ground, and Arethusa, still endeavoring
to escape, plunged into the abyss and, passing through the
bowels of the earth, came out in Sicily, still followed by the passionate
river-god.</p>

<p><b>95. The Fate of Act&aelig;on.</b><a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Diana's severity toward young Act&aelig;on,
grandson of Cadmus whose kindred fell under the curse of
Mars, is thus narrated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image077.jpg" width="400" height="252" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 71. Act&aelig;on</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>One day, having repaired to a valley inclosed by cypresses and
pines, where gushed a fountain of sparkling water, the chaste Diana
handed her javelin, her quiver, and her bow to one nymph, her
robe to another, while a third unbound the sandals from her feet.
Then Crocale, the most skillful of them, arranged her hair, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>Nephele, Hyale, and the rest drew water in capacious urns. While
the huntress queen was thus employed in the labors of the toilet,
Act&aelig;on, the son of Autono&euml; and Arist&aelig;us, having quitted his companions
of the chase and rambling without any especial object, came
to the place, led thither by his destiny. As he presented himself at
the entrance of the cave, the nymphs, seeing a man, screamed and
rushed towards the goddess to hide her with their bodies. But she
was taller than the rest and overtopped them all by a head. Such
a color as tinges the clouds at sunset or at dawn came over the
countenance of Diana, thus taken by surprise. Surrounded as she
was by her nymphs, she yet turned half away and sought with a
sudden impulse for her arrows. As they were not at hand, she
dashed the water into the face of the intruder, saying, "Now go
and tell, if you can, that you have seen Diana unappareled." Immediately
a pair of branching stag's horns grew out of the huntsman's
head, his neck gained in length, his ears grew sharp-pointed,
his hands became feet, his arms, his long legs, and his body were
covered with a hairy spotted hide. Fear took the place of his
former boldness, and the hero fled. What should he do?&mdash;go
home to the palace or lie hid in the woods? While he hesitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
his dogs saw him. Over rocks and cliffs, through mountain gorges
that seemed impracticable, he fled, and they followed. The air
resounded with the bark of the dogs. Presently one fastened on
his back, another seized his shoulder; the rest of the pack came
up and buried their teeth in his flesh. His friends and fellow-huntsmen
cheered on the dogs, and, looking everywhere for Act&aelig;on,
called on him to join the sport. At the sound of his name, he
turned his head and heard them regret that he should be away.
He earnestly wished he was. But Diana had no pity for him, nor
was her anger appeased till the dogs had torn his life out.</p>

<p><b>96. The Fortunes and Death of Orion.</b> Orion, the son of Neptune,
was a giant and a mighty hunter, whose prowess and manly
favor gained for him the rare good will of Diana.</p>

<p>It is related that he loved Merope, the daughter of &OElig;nopion,
king of Chios, and sought her in marriage. He cleared the island
of wild beasts and brought the spoils of the chase as presents to
his beloved; but as &OElig;nopion constantly deferred his consent,
Orion attempted to gain possession of the maiden by violence.
Her father, incensed at his conduct, made Orion drunk, deprived
him of his sight, and cast him out on the seashore. The blinded
hero, instructed by an oracle to seek the rays of morning, followed
the sound of a Cyclops' hammer till he reached Lemnos, where
Vulcan, taking pity on him, gave him Cedalion, one of his men,
to be his guide to the abode of the sun. Placing Cedalion on his
shoulders, Orion proceeded to the east, and there meeting the sun-god,
was restored to sight by his beam.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>After this he dwelt as a hunter with the queen of the echoing
chase; and it was even hinted that she loved him. Her brother,
highly displeased, often chid her, but to no purpose. One day,
therefore, observing Orion as he waded through the sea with his
head just above the water, Apollo pointed out the black object to
his sister, and maintained that she could not hit it. The archer
goddess discharged a shaft with fatal aim: the waves rolled the
dead body of Orion to the land. Then bewailing her fatal error
with many tears, Diana placed him among the stars, where he
appears as a giant, with a girdle, sword, lion's skin, and club.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>Sirius, his dog, follows him, and the Pleiads fly before him.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In
the beginning of winter, all through the night, Orion follows the
chase across the heavens; but with dawn he sinks toward the
waters of his father Neptune. In the beginning of summer, he
may be seen with daybreak in the eastern sky, where, beloved by
Aurora, he remains gradually paling before the light of day till,
finally, Diana, jealous of his happiness, draws her gentle darts
and slays him.</p>

were daughters of Atlas, and nymphs of Diana's train. One day
Orion saw them in B&oelig;otia, became enamored of them, and gave
pursuit. In their distress they prayed to the gods to change their
form. Jupiter, accordingly, turned them into pigeons, and made
them a constellation. Though their number was seven, only six
stars are visible; for Electra, it is said, left her place that she
might not behold the ruin of Troy, which had been founded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>her son Dardanus. The sight had such an effect on her sisters
that they blanched, and have been pale ever since. But Electra
became a comet; her hair floating wildly behind her, she still
inconsolably ranges the expanse of heaven. According to some,
the lost Pleiad is Merope, who was vested with mortality in consequence
of her marriage with the mortal Sisyphus, king of Corinth.</p>

<p>Tennyson's reference
to the Pleiads, in "Locksley
Hall," is of course

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 73. Endymion</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><b>98. Endymion.</b> The
frequent absence of Diana
from her duties in heaven
is said to have awakened
suspicion among the deities
of Olympus, who
doubted whether she actually
occupied these intervals
with hunting. It is
easy to imagine the satisfaction
with which Venus,
who so often had been
reproached by Diana with
her undue fondness of
beautiful youths, would
welcome news of a corresponding
weakness on the
part of the cold-hearted
and apparently unyielding
huntress queen. And such satisfaction Venus once enjoyed, if we
may trust the later classical and the modern poets who have identified
Diana with Selene, the more ancient goddess of the moon.</p>

<p>For, one calm, clear night Selene looked down upon the beautiful
Endymion, who fed his flock on Mount Latmos, and saw
him sleeping. The heart of the goddess was unquestionably warmed
by his surpassing beauty. She came down to him; she kissed him;
she watched over him while he slept. She visited him again and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
again. But her secret could not long be hidden from the company
of Olympus. For more and more frequently she was absent from
her station in the sky, and toward morning she was ever paler
and more weary with her watching. When, finally, her love was
discovered, Jupiter gave Endymion, who had been thus honored,
a choice between death in any manner that was preferable, or perpetual
youth united with perpetual sleep. Endymion chose the
latter. He still sleeps in his Carian cave, and still the mistress of
the moon slips from her nocturnal course to visit him. She takes
care, too, that his fortunes shall not suffer by his inactive life:
she yields his flock increase, and guards his sheep and lambs from
beasts of prey.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p><b>99. Myths of Venus.</b> Round the goddess of love cluster
romances of her own tender passion, of the affairs of the winged
Cupid, and of the loves of the worshipers at her shrine. Of the
affection of Venus for Mars and of her relations with Anchises,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>the father of &AElig;neas, mention is elsewhere made. The following
is the myth of Venus and Adonis.</p>

<p><b>100. Adonis.</b><a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The sweetly smiling goddess, playing one day
with her boy Cupid, wounded her bosom with one of his arrows.
Before the wound healed, she looked upon Adonis, the son of
Cinyras and Myrrha, and was captivated by him. She no longer
took any interest in her favorite resorts,&mdash;Paphos, and Cnidos,
and Amathus, rich in metals. She absented herself even from
Olympus, for Adonis was dearer to her than heaven. Him she
followed and bore him company. She who loved to recline in
the shade, with no care but to cultivate her charms, now rambled
through the woods and over the hills, girt like the huntress Diana.
She chased game that is safe to hunt, but kept clear of the wolves
and bears. She charged Adonis, too, to beware of dangerous
animals. "Be brave toward the timid," she would say, "courage
against the courageous is not safe." Having thus, on one occasion,
warned him, she mounted her chariot drawn by swans and drove
away through the air. But Adonis was too noble to heed such
counsels. The dogs had roused a wild boar from his lair, and the
youth threw his spear and wounded the animal with a sidelong
stroke. The beast drew out the weapon with his jaws, and, rushing
after Adonis, buried his tusks in the lad's side, and stretched him
dying upon the plain. The rest of the story is thus recounted:</p>


<h4>THE LAMENT FOR ADONIS<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... Low on the hills is lying the lovely Adonis, and his thigh with the
boar's tusk, his white thigh with the boar's tusk, is wounded; and sorrow on
Cypris he brings, as softly he breathes his life away.</p>

<p>His dark blood drips down his skin of snow; beneath his brows his eyes
wax heavy and dim; and the rose flees from his lip, and thereon the very kiss
is dying, the kiss that Cypris will never forego.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... She hath lost her lovely lord, with him she hath lost her sacred beauty.
Fair was the form of Cypris while Adonis was living, but her beauty has died
with Adonis! <i>Woe, woe for Cypris</i>, the mountains all are saying. And the
oak trees answer, <i>Woe for Adonis!</i>
And the rivers bewail the sorrows of
Aphrodite, and the wells are weeping
Adonis on the mountains. The flowers
flush red for anguish, and Cytherea
through all the mountain-knees, through
every dell, doth shrill the piteous dirge:</p>

<p><i>Woe, woe for Cytherea, he hath</i>
<i>perished, the lovely Adonis!</i></p>

<p>... When she saw, when she
marked the unstanched wound of
Adonis, when she saw the bright red
blood about his languid thigh, she cast
her arms abroad, and moaned, "Abide
with me, Adonis, hapless Adonis, abide!... Awake,
Adonis, for a little while,
and kiss me yet again, the latest kiss!...
This kiss will I treasure, even as
thyself, Adonis, since, ah, ill-fated, thou
art fleeing me, thou art fleeing far,
Adonis, and art faring to Acheron,
to that hateful king and cruel, while
wretched I yet live, being a goddess,
and may not follow thee! Persephone,
take thou my lover, my lord, for thyself
art stronger than I, and all lovely
things drift down to thee. But I am
ill-fated, inconsolable is my anguish;
and I lament mine Adonis, dead to me,
and I have no rest for sorrow.</p>

<p>"Thou diest, oh, thrice-desired, and
my desire hath flown away as a dream!
Nay, widowed is Cytherea, and idle are
the Loves along the halls! With thee has
the girdle of my beauty perished. For
why, ah, overbold, didst thou follow the
chase, and being so fair, why wert thou
thus overhardy to fight with beasts?"</p>

<p>So Cypris bewailed her, the Loves
join in the lament:</p>

<p><i>Woe, woe for Cytherea, he hath</i>
<i>perished, the lovely Adonis!</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A tear the Paphian sheds for each blood-drop of Adonis, and tears and
blood on the earth are turned to flowers. The blood brings forth the rose;
the tears, the wind-flower.</p>

<p><i>Woe, woe for Adonis, he hath perished, the lovely Adonis!</i></p>

<p>... Cease, Cytherea, from thy lamentations, to-day refrain from thy dirges.
Thou must again bewail him, again must weep for him another year.</p></div>

<p><b>101. Cupid and Psyche.</b><a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> A certain king and queen had three
daughters. The charms of the two elder were more than common,
but the beauty of the youngest was such that the poverty of language
is unable to express its praise. In fact, Venus found her
altars deserted, while men paid their vows to this virgin. When
Psyche passed, the people sang her praises and strewed her way
with chaplets and flowers.</p>

<p>This perversion of homage gave great offense to Venus, who
complained that Paris might just as well not have yielded her the
palm of beauty over Pallas and Juno, if a mortal were thus to usurp
her honors. Wherefore she called Cupid and, pointing out Psyche
to him, bade him infuse into the bosom of that haughty girl a
passion for some low, unworthy being.</p>

<p>There were in Venus's garden two fountains,&mdash;one of sweet
waters, the other of bitter. Cupid filled two amber vases, one from
each fountain, and suspending them from the top of his quiver,
hastened to the chamber of Psyche, whom he found asleep. He
shed a few drops from the bitter fountain over her lips, though
the sight of her almost moved him to pity; and then he touched
her side with the point of his arrow. She awoke, and opening
her eyes upon Cupid (himself invisible), so startled him that in
his confusion he wounded himself with his arrow. Heedless of
his wound, his thought now was to repair the mischief he had
done. He poured, at once, the waters of joy over her silken
ringlets.</p>

<p>But Psyche, henceforth frowned upon by Venus, derived no
benefit from her charms. Her two elder sisters had long been
married to princes; but Psyche's beauty failed to awaken love.
Consequently her parents, afraid that they had unwittingly incurred
the anger of the gods, consulted the oracle of Apollo.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<p>They received answer, "The virgin is destined for the bride of no
mortal lover. Her husband awaits her on the top of the mountain.
He is a monster whom neither gods nor men can resist."</p>

<p>This dreadful decree of the oracle filled the people with dismay;
but, at Psyche's request, preparations for her fate were
made. The royal maid took her place in a procession, which
more resembled a funeral than a nuptial pomp, and with her
parents, amid the lamentations of their subjects, ascended the
mountain, where she was left alone.</p>

<p>While Psyche stood there, panting with fear and with eyes full
of tears, the gentle Zephyr lifted her and, with an easy motion,
bore her to a flowery dale. By degrees her mind became composed,
and she laid herself down on the grassy bank to sleep.
When she awoke refreshed with sleep, she beheld near by a
pleasant grove of tall and stately trees. Entering, she discovered
in the midst a fountain, and fast by a palace whose august front
showed that it was not the work of mortal hands, but the happy
retreat of some god. She approached the building and entered.
Every object she met filled her with pleasure and amazement.
Golden pillars supported the vaulted roof, and the walls were
enriched with carvings and paintings that represented beasts of
the chase and rural scenes. Other apartments were filled with
still other beautiful and precious productions of nature and art.</p>

<p>While her eyes were thus occupied, the voice of an invisible
being addressed her: "Sovereign lady, all that thou beholdest is
thine. We whose voices thou dost hear are thy servants. Retire,
we pray thee, to thy chamber, repose on thy bed of down, and
when it may please thee repair to the bath. Food awaits in the
adjoining alcove."</p>

<p>After repose and the refreshment of the bath, Psyche seated
herself in the alcove, where, without any visible aid, a table immediately
presented itself, covered with delicacies and nectareous
wines. Her ears, too, were delighted with music from invisible
performers.</p>

<p>For a long time she did not see her husband. He came in the
hours of darkness and fled before the dawn of morning; but his
accents were full of love and inspired a like passion in her. Often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
she begged him to stay and let her behold him, but he would not
consent. "Having looked upon me," he said, "mayhap thou
wouldst fear, mayhap adore, me; but all I ask of thee is love. I
would rather thou shouldst love me as an equal than adore me as
a god." This reasoning somewhat quieted Psyche for a time. But
the thought of her parents and of her sisters, left in ignorance
of her fate, preyed on her
mind to such a degree that
at last, telling her distress
to her lord, she drew from
him an unwilling consent
that her sisters should be
brought to see her.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 197px;">

</div>

<p>Zephyr, promptly obedient,
soon brought them
across the mountain down
to their sister's valley. They
embraced her. She returned
their caresses, and then committed
them to the care of
her attendant voices, who
should refresh them in her
bath and at her table, and
show them her treasures.
The view of these delights
caused envy to enter their
bosoms. They plied their
fortunate sister with questions
about her husband.
Psyche replied that he was
a beautiful youth, who generally spent the daytime in hunting
upon the mountains. The sisters, not satisfied with this reply,
soon made her confess that she had never seen him. Then they
proceeded to fill her bosom with dark suspicions. Probably her
husband was a dreadful monster, such as the Pythian oracle had
prophesied. Probably he was a direful serpent, who nourished
her now to devour her by and by. They advised her to provide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
herself against the night with a lamp and a sharp knife, told her
what to do if her husband turned out the monster that they surmised,
and, so saying, departed.</p>

<p>These persuasions Psyche resisted as well as she could, but they
did not fail to have their effect on her mind. She prepared a lamp
and a sharp knife, and hid them out of sight of her husband. That
night, when he had fallen into his first sleep, she silently rose and
uncovering her lamp&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">Scarce kept back a cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At what she saw; for there before her lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very Love brighter than dawn of day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he lay there smiling, her own name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His gentle lips in sleep began to frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as to touch her face, his hand did move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O then, indeed, her faint heart swelled for love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she began to sob, and tears fell fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the bed.&mdash;But as she turned at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To quench the lamp, there happed a little thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That quenched her new delight, for flickering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The treacherous flame cast on his shoulder fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A burning drop; he woke, and seeing her there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meaning of that sad sight knew full well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was there need the piteous tale to tell.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Without a word, Cupid spread his white wings, and flew out of
window. Psyche, in vain endeavoring to follow, fell to the earth.
For but an instant Cupid, staying, reproached her with distrust of
him. "No other punishment inflict I than to leave thee forever.
Love cannot dwell with suspicion." And so he flew away.</p>

<p>When Psyche had recovered some degree of composure, she
looked around her. The palace and gardens had vanished. She
found herself not far from the city where her sisters dwelt.
Thither she repaired, and told them the story of her misfortunes,
whereat they inwardly rejoiced. "For now," thought they, "he
will perhaps choose one of us." With this idea, they rose early
the next morning and, ascending the mountain, each called upon
Zephyr to receive her and bear her to his lord; then, leaping up,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>failed of the support of Zephyr, fell down the precipice, and was
dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>Psyche, meanwhile, wandered day and night, without food or
repose, in search of her husband. But he was lying heartsick in
the chamber of his mother; and that goddess was absent upon her
own affairs. Then the white sea gull which floats over the waves
dived into the middle deep,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And rowing with his glistening wings arrived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Aphrodite's bower beneath the sea.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She, as yet unaware of her son's mischance, was joyously consorting
with her handmaidens; but he, the sea gull,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he with garrulous and laughing tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke up his news; how Eros fallen sick<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thyself among us now a dreary space:<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>And Venus cried angrily, "My son, then, has a mistress! And
it is Psyche, who witched away my beauty and was the rival of my
godhead, whom he loves!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<p>Therewith she issued from the sea, and, returning to her golden
chamber, found there the lad sick, as she had heard, and cried
from the doorway, "Well done, truly! to trample thy mother's
precepts under foot, to spare my enemy that cross of an unworthy
love; nay, unite her to thyself, child as thou art, that I might have
a daughter-in-law who hates me! I will make thee repent of thy
sport, and the savor of thy marriage bitter. There is one who shall
chasten this body of thine, put out thy torch, and unstring thy bow.
Not till she has plucked forth that hair, into which so oft these
hands have smoothed the golden light, and sheared away thy
wings, shall I feel the injury done me avenged." And with this
she hastened in anger from the doors.</p>

<p>And Ceres and Juno met her, and sought to know the meaning
of her troubled countenance. "Ye come in season," she cried; "I
pray you, find for me Psyche. It must needs be that ye have heard
the disgrace of my house." And they, ignorant of what was done,
would have soothed her anger, saying, "What fault, Mistress, hath
thy son committed, that thou wouldst destroy the girl he loves?
Knowest thou not that he is now of age? Because he wears his
years so lightly must he seem to thee ever to be a child? Wilt
thou forever thus pry into the pastimes of thy son, always accusing
his wantonness, and blaming in him those delicate wiles which are
all thine own?" Thus, in secret fear of the boy's bow, did they
seek to please him with their gracious patronage. But Venus,
angry at their light taking of her wrongs, turned her back upon
them, and with hasty steps made her way once more to the sea.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>And soon after, Psyche herself reached the temple of Ceres,
where she won the favor of the goddess by arranging in due order
the heaps of mingled grain and ears and the carelessly scattered
harvest implements that lay there. The holy Ceres then counseled
her to submit to Venus, to try humbly to win her forgiveness,
and, mayhap, through her favor regain the lover that
was lost.</p>

<p>Obeying the commands of Ceres, Psyche took her way to the
temple of the golden-crowned Cypris. That goddess received her
with angry countenance, called her an undutiful and faithless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>servant, taunted her with the wound given to her husband, and
insisted that for so ill-favored a girl there was no way of meriting a
lover save by dint of industry. Thereupon she ordered Psyche to
be led to the storehouse of the temple, where was laid up a great
quantity of wheat, barley, millet, vetches, beans, and lentils prepared
for food for her pigeons, and gave order, "Take and separate
all these grains, putting all of the same kind in a parcel by
themselves,&mdash;and see that thou get it done before evening." This
said, Venus departed and left the girl to her task. But Psyche, in
perfect consternation at the enormous task, sat stupid and silent;
nor would the work have been accomplished had not Cupid stirred
up the ants to take compassion on her. They separated the pile,
sorting each kind to its parcel and vanishing out of sight in a
moment.</p>

<p>At the approach of twilight, Cytherea returned from the banquet
of the gods, breathing odors and crowned with roses. Seeing the
task done, she promptly exclaimed, "This is no work of thine,
wicked one, but his, whom to thine own and his misfortune thou
hast enticed,"&mdash;threw the girl a piece of black bread for her
supper, and departed.</p>

<p>Next morning, however, the goddess, ordering Psyche to be summoned,
commanded her to fetch a sample of wool gathered from
each of the golden-shining sheep that fed beyond a neighboring
river. Obediently the princess went to the riverside, prepared to
do her best to execute the command. But the god of that stream
inspired the reeds with harmonious murmurs that dissuaded her
from venturing among the golden rams while they raged under
the influence of the rising sun. Psyche, observing the directions
of the compassionate river-god, crossed when the noontide sun
had driven the cattle to the shade, gathered the woolly gold from
the bushes where it was clinging, and returned to Venus with her
arms full of the shining fleece. But, far from commending her,
that implacable mistress said, "I know very well that by the aid of
another thou hast done this; not yet am I assured that thou hast
skill to be of use. Here, now, take this box to Proserpine and say,
'My mistress Venus entreats thee to send her a little of thy beauty,
for in tending her sick son she hath lost some of her own.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Psyche, satisfied that her destruction was at hand, doomed as
she was to travel afoot to Erebus, thought to shorten the journey
by precipitating herself at once from the summit of a tower. But
a voice from the tower, restraining her from this rash purpose,
explained how by a certain cave she might reach the realm of
Pluto; how she might avoid the peril of the road, pass by Cerberus,
and prevail on Charon to take her across the black river
and bring her back again. The voice, also, especially cautioned her
against prying into the box filled with the beauty of Proserpine.</p>

<p>So, taking heed to her ways, the unfortunate girl traveled safely
to the kingdom of Pluto. She was admitted to the palace of
Proserpine, where, contenting herself with plain fare instead of the
delicious banquet that was offered her, she delivered her message
from Venus. Presently the box, filled with the precious commodity,
was restored to her; and glad was she to come out once more into
the light of day.</p>

<p>But having got so far successfully through her dangerous task, a
desire seized her to examine the contents of the box, and to spread
the least bit of the divine beauty on her cheeks that she might
appear to more advantage in the eyes of her beloved husband.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Therewith down by the wayside did she sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned the box round, long regarding it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at the last, with trembling hands, undid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clasp, and fearfully raised up the lid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what was there she saw not, for her head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell back, and nothing she remember&egrave;d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all her life, yet nought of rest she had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hope of which makes hapless mortals glad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For while her limbs were sunk in deadly sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most like to death, over her heart 'gan creep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill dreams; so that for fear and great distress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would have cried, but in her helplessness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could open not her mouth, or frame a word.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Cupid, now recovered from his wound, slipped through a
crack in the window of his chamber, flew to the spot where his
beloved lay, gathered up the sleep from her body and inclosed it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>again in the box, then waked Psyche with the touch of an arrow.
"Again," said he, "hast thou almost perished by thy curiosity.
But now perform the task
imposed upon thee by my
mother, and I will care
for the rest."</p>

<p>Then Cupid, swift as
lightning penetrating the
heights of heaven, presented
himself before Jupiter
with his supplication.
Jupiter lent a favoring ear
and pleaded the cause of
the lovers with Venus.
Gaining her consent, he
ordered Mercury to convey
Psyche to the heavenly
abodes. On her advent,
the king of the immortals,
handing her a cup of ambrosia,
said, "Drink this,
Psyche, and be immortal.
Thy Cupid shall never break
from the knot in which he
is tied; these nuptials shall
indeed be perpetual."</p>

<p>Thus Psyche was at last united to Cupid; and in due season a
daughter was born to them whose name was Pleasure.</p>

<p>The story of Cupid and Psyche first appears in the works of
Apuleius, a writer of the second century of our era. It is therefore
of much more recent date than most of the classic myths.</p>

<p><b>102. Keats' Ode to Psyche.</b> To this fact allusion is made in the
following poem:</p>

<p>The loves of the devotees of Venus are as the sands of the sea
for number. Below are given the fortunes of a few: Hippomenes,
Hero, Pygmalion, Pyramus, and Phaon. The
favor of the goddess toward Paris, who awarded
her the palm of beauty in preference to Juno
and Minerva, will occupy our attention in connection
with the story of the Trojan War.</p>

<p><b>103. Atalanta's Race.</b><a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Atalanta, the daughter
of Sch&oelig;neus of B&oelig;otia, had been warned
by an oracle that marriage would be fatal to her
happiness. Consequently she fled the society
of men and devoted herself to the sports of the
chase. Fair, fearless, swift, and free, in beauty
and in desire she was a Cynthia,&mdash;of mortal
form and with a woman's heart. To all suitors
(for she had many) she made answer: "I will
be the prize of him only who shall conquer me
in the race; but death must be the penalty of
all who try and fail." In spite of this hard condition
some would try. Of one such race Hippomenes
was to be judge. It was his thought,
at first, that these suitors risked too much for
a wife. But when he saw Atalanta lay aside her
robe for the race with one of them, he changed his mind and
began to swell with envy of whomsoever seemed likely to win.</p>

<p>The virgin darted forward. As she ran she looked more beautiful
than ever. The breezes gave wings to her feet; her hair flew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>over her shoulders, and the gay fringe of her garment fluttered
behind her. A ruddy hue tinged the whiteness of her skin, such
as a crimson curtain casts on a marble wall. Her competitor was
distanced and was put to death without mercy. Hippomenes, not
daunted by this result, fixed his eyes on the virgin and said, "Why
boast of beating those laggards? I offer myself for the contest."
Atalanta looked at him with pity in her face and hardly knew
whether she would rather conquer so goodly a youth or not. While
she hesitated, the spectators grew impatient for the contest and
her father prompted her to prepare. Then Hippomenes addressed
a prayer to Cypris: "Help me, Venus, for thou hast impelled
me." Venus heard and was propitious.</p>

<p>She gathered three golden apples from the garden of her temple
in her own island of Cyprus and, unseen by any, gave them to
Hippomenes, telling him how to use them. Atalanta and her lover
were ready. The signal was given.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">They both started; he, by one stride, first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she half pitied him so beautiful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Running to meet his death, yet was resolved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To conquer: soon she near'd him, and he felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rapid and repeated gush of breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind his shoulder.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">From his hand now dropt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A golden apple: she lookt down and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glitter on the grass, yet on she ran.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He dropt a second; now she seem'd to stoop:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dropt a third; and now she stoopt indeed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, swifter than a wren picks up a grain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of millet, rais'd her head: it was too late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only one step, only one breath, too late.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hippomenes had toucht the maple goal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With but two fingers, leaning pronely forth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stood in mute despair; the prize was won.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now each walkt slowly forward, both so tired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both alike breathed hard, and stopt at times.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he turn'd round to her, she lowered her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cover'd with blushes, and held out her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden apple in it.<br /></span>
<span class="i24">"Leave me now,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said she, "I must walk homeward."<br /></span>
<span class="i34">He did take<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The apple and the hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i24">"Both I detain,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said he, "the other two I dedicate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the two Powers that soften virgin hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eros and Aphrodite; and this one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her who ratifies the nuptial vow."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She would have wept to see her father weep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some God pitied her, and purple wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(What God's were they?) hovered and interposed.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the oracle was yet to be fulfilled. The lovers, full of their
own happiness, after all, forgot to pay due honor to Aphrodite,
and the goddess was provoked at their ingratitude. She caused
them to give offense to Cybele. That powerful goddess took from
them their human form: the huntress heroine, triumphing in the
blood of her lovers, she made a lioness; her lord and master a lion,&mdash;and
yoked them to her car, where they are still to be seen in all
representations in statuary or painting of the goddess Cybele.</p>

<p><b>104 Hero and Leander</b> were star-crossed lovers of later classical
fiction.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Although their story is not of supernatural beings, or of
events necessarily influenced by supernatural agencies, and therefore
not mythical in the strict sense of the word, it deserves to be

tradition. The poet Marlowe puts the story into English thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In view and opposite two cities stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And offer'd as a dower his burning throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she should sit, for men to gaze upon....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, looking in her face, was strooken blind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this is true: so like was one the other,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he imagined Hero was his mother;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oftentimes into her bosom flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About her naked neck his bare arms threw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid his childish head upon her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with still panting rockt, there took his rest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Abydos dwelt the manly Leander, who, as luck would have
it, bethought himself one day of the festival of Venus in Sestos,
and thither fared to do obeisance to the goddess.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On this feast-day,&mdash;O curs&egrave;d day and hour!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went Hero through Sestos, from her tower<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fair a church as this had Venus none;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The walls were of discolored jasper-stone, ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the midst a silver altar stood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Hero, sacrificing turtle's blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And modestly they opened as she rose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus Leander was enamour&egrave;d.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gaz'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till with the fire, that from his countenance blaz'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such power and virtue hath an amorous look.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">It lies not in our power to love or hate,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We wish that one should lose, the other win;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And one especially do we affect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reason no man knows; let it suffice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where both deliberate, the love is slight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He kneel'd; but unto <i>her</i> devoutly prayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chaste Hero to herself thus softly said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Were I the saint he worships, I would hear him";<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as she spake those words, came somewhat near him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He started up; she blush'd as one asham'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith Leander much more was inflam'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He touch'd her hand; in touching it she trembled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love deeply grounded, hardly is dissembled....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So they conversed by touch of hands, till Leander, plucking up
courage, began to plead with words, with sighs and tears.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These arguments he us'd, and many more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith she yielded, that was won before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hero's looks yielded, but her words made war:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Women are won when they begin to jar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus having swallow'd Cupid's golden hook,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more she striv'd, the deeper was she strook:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, evilly feigning anger, strove she still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would be thought to grant against her will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So having paus'd awhile, at last she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Who taught thee rhetoric to deceive a maid?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay me! such words as these should I abhor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I like them for the orator."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that Leander stoop'd to have embrac'd her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from his spreading arms away she cast her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus bespake him: "Gentle youth, forbear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To touch the sacred garments which I wear." ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then she told him of the turret by the murmuring sea where
all day long she tended Venus' swans and sparrows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come thither." As she spake this, her tongue tripp'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For unawares, "Come thither," from her slipp'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suddenly her former color chang'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here and there her eyes through anger rang'd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a planet moving several ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At one self instant, she, poor soul, assays,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Loving, not to love at all, and every part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strove to resist the motions of her heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hands so pure, so innocent, nay, such<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As might have made Heaven stoop to have a touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did she uphold to Venus, and again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vow'd spotless chastity; but all in vain;<br /></span>

<p>For a season all went well. Guided by a torch which his mistress
reared upon the tower, he was wont of nights to swim the
strait that he might enjoy her company. But one night a tempest
arose and the sea was rough; his strength failed and he was
drowned. The waves bore his body to the European shore, where
Hero became aware of his death, and in her despair cast herself
into the sea and perished.</p>

<p><b>105. Pygmalion and the Statue.</b><a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Pygmalion saw so much to
blame in women, that he came at last to abhor the sex and resolved
to live unmarried. He was a sculptor, and had made with wonderful
skill a statue of ivory, so beautiful that no living woman was to
compare with it. It was indeed the perfect semblance of a maiden
that seemed to be alive and that was prevented from moving only
by modesty. His art was so perfect that it concealed itself, and its
product looked like the workmanship of nature. Pygmalion at last
fell in love with his counterfeit creation. Oftentimes he laid his
hand upon it as if to assure himself whether it were living or not,
and could not even then believe that it was only ivory.</p>

<p>The festival of Venus was at hand,&mdash;a festival celebrated with
great pomp at Cyprus. Victims were offered, the altars smoked,
and the odor of incense filled the air. When Pygmalion had performed
his part in the solemnities, he stood before the altar and,
according to one of our poets, timidly said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Aphrodite, kind and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That what thou wilt canst give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, listen to a sculptor's prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bid mine image live!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me the ivory and gold<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That clothe her cedar frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are beautiful, indeed, but cold;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Ah, touch them with thy flame!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, bid her move those lips of rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bid float that golden hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let her choose me, as I chose,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This fairest of the fair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then an altar in thy court<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll offer, decked with gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there thy servants shall resort,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy doves be bought and sold!<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>According to another version of the story, he said not, "bid
mine image live," but "one like my ivory virgin." At any rate,
with such a prayer he threw incense on the flame of the altar.
Whereupon Venus, as an omen of her favor, caused the flame to
shoot up thrice a fiery point into the air.</p>

<p>When Pygmalion reached his home, to his amazement he saw
before him his statue garlanded with flowers.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Yet while he stood, and knew not what to do<br /></span>

<p>The maiden was called Galatea. Venus blessed the nuptials, and
from the union Paphos was born, by whose name the city, sacred
to Venus, is known.</p>

<p><b>106. Pyramus and Thisbe.</b><a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Pyramus was the handsomest youth
and Thisbe the fairest maiden in Babylonia, where Semiramis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>reigned. Their parents occupied adjoining houses. Propinquity
brought the young people together, and acquaintance ripened into
love. They would gladly have married, but their parents forbade.
One thing, however, parents could not forbid (for Venus and Cupid
favored the match),&mdash;that love should glow with equal ardor in the
bosoms of both. They conversed by signs and glances, and the fire
burned the more intensely
that it was covered. In the
wall between the two houses
there was a crack, caused by
some fault in the structure.
It afforded a passage to
the voice; and tender messages
passed back and forth
through the gap. When night
came and they must say
farewell, the lovers pressed
their lips upon the wall, she
on her side, he on his.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 80. Thisbe</span></p>

<p>From the painting by Edward Burne-Jones</p></div>
</div>

<p>One morning, when Aurora
had put out the stars
and the sun had melted the
frost from the grass, they
met at the accustomed spot
and arranged a meeting for
that night at a well-known
edifice, standing without the
city's bounds,&mdash;the Tomb
of Ninus. The one who
first arrived should await the other at the foot of a white mulberry
tree near a cool spring. Evening came. Thisbe, arriving first, sat
alone by the monument in the dim light of the evening. Suddenly
she descried a lioness, her jaws reeking with recent slaughter,
approaching the fountain to slake her thirst. The maiden fled at
the sight, dropping her veil as she ran. The lioness, after drinking
at the spring, turned toward the woods, and, seeing the veil on
the ground, tossed and rent it with her bloody mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Pyramus approached the place of meeting. He saw in
the sand the footsteps of the lion. He found the veil all rent and
bloody. "O, hapless girl," cried he, "I have been the cause of
thy death; but I follow thee!" So saying, he drew his sword and
plunged it into his heart. The blood spurted from the wound and
tinged the white mulberries of the tree all red, and, sinking into
the earth, reached the roots, so that the sanguine hue mounted
through the trunk to the fruit.</p>

<p>By this time Thisbe, still trembling with fear, yet wishing not
to disappoint her lover, stepped cautiously forth, looking anxiously
for the youth, eager to tell him the danger she had escaped.
When she came to the spot and saw the changed color of the
mulberries, she doubted whether it was the same place. While
she hesitated, she saw the form of her lover struggling in the
agonies of death. She screamed and beat her breast, she embraced
the lifeless body, poured tears into its wounds, and imprinted
kisses on the cold lips. "O, Pyramus," she cried, "what has done
this? It is thine own Thisbe that speaks." At the name of Thisbe
Pyramus opened his eyes, then closed them again. She saw her
veil stained with blood and the scabbard empty of its sword.
"Thine own hand has slain thee, and for my sake," she said. "I,
too, can be brave for once, and my love is as strong as thine.
But ye, unhappy parents of us both, deny us not our united request.
As love and death have joined us, let one tomb contain us.
And thou, tree, retain the marks of slaughter. Let thy berries
still serve for memorials of our blood." So saying, she plunged
the sword into her breast. The two bodies were buried in one
sepulcher, and the tree henceforth produced purple berries.</p>

<p><b>107. Phaon</b> ferried a boat between Lesbos and Chios. One day
the queen of Paphos and Amathus,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> in the guise of an ugly crone,
begged a passage, which was so good-naturedly granted that in recompense
she bestowed on the ferryman a salve possessing magical
properties of youth and beauty. As a consequence of the use made
of it by Phaon, the women of Lesbos went wild for love of him.
None, however, admired him more than the poetess Sappho, who
addressed to him some of her warmest and rarest love-songs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p><b>108. The Vengeance of Venus.</b> Venus did not fail to follow
with her vengeance those who dishonored her rites or defied her
power. The youth Hippolytus who, eschewing love, preferred
Diana to her, she brought miserably to his ruin. Polyphonte she
transformed into an owl, Arsino&euml; into a stone, and Myrrha into a
myrtle tree.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Her influence in the main was of mingled bane and
blessing, as in the cases of Helen, &OElig;none, Pasipha&euml;, Ariadne,
Procris, Eriphyle, Laodamia, and others whose stories are elsewhere
told.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p><b>109. Myths of Mercury.</b> According to Homer,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Maia bore
Mercury at the peep of day,&mdash;a schemer subtle beyond all belief.
He began playing on the lyre at noon; for, wandering out of the
lofty cavern of Cyllene, he found a tortoise, picked it up, bored
the life out of the beast, fitted the shell with bridge and reeds,
and accompanied himself therewith as he sang a strain of unpremeditated
sweetness. At evening of the same day he stole the
oxen of his half brother Apollo from the Pierian mountains, where
they were grazing. He covered their hoofs with tamarisk twigs,
and, still further to deceive the pursuer, drove them backward into
a cave at Pylos. There rubbing laurel branches together, he made
fire and sacrificed, as an example for men to follow, two heifers
to the twelve gods (himself included). Then home he went and
slept, innocent as a new-born child! To his mother's warning that
Apollo would catch and punish him, this innocent replied, in effect,
"I know a trick better than that!" And when the puzzled Apollo,
having traced the knavery to this babe in swaddling clothes, accused
him of it, the sweet boy swore a great oath by his father's
head that he stole not the cows, nor knew even what cows might
be, for he had only that moment heard the name of them. Apollo
proceeded to trounce the baby, with scant success, however, for
Mercury persisted in his assumption of ignorance. So the twain
appeared before their sire, and Apollo entered his complaint: he
had not seen nor ever dreamed of so precocious a cattle-stealer,
liar, and full-fledged knave as this young rascal. To all of which
Mercury responded that he was, on the contrary, a veracious
person, but that his brother Apollo was a coward to bully a helpless
little new-born thing that slept, nor ever had thought of "lifting"
cattle. The wink with which the lad of Cyllene accompanied this
asseveration threw Jupiter into uncontrollable roars of laughter.
Consequently, the quarrel was patched up: Mercury gave Apollo
the new-made lyre; Apollo presented the prodigy with a glittering
whiplash and installed him herdsman of his oxen. Nay even, when
Mercury had sworn by sacred Styx no more to try his cunning in
theft upon Apollo, that god in gratitude invested him with the
magic wand of wealth, happiness, and dreams (the <i>caduceus</i>), it
being understood, however, that Mercury should indicate the future
only by signs, not by speech or song as did Apollo. It is said that
the god of gain avenged himself for this enforced rectitude upon
others: upon Venus, whose girdle he purloined; upon Neptune,
whose trident he filched; upon Vulcan, whose tongs he borrowed;
and upon Mars, whose sword he stole.</p>

<span class="ph4">MYTHS OF THE GREAT DIVINITIES OF EARTH</span></h3>


<p><b>110. Myths of Bacchus.</b> Since the adventures of Ceres, although
she was a goddess of earth, are intimately connected with the life
of the underworld, they will be related in the sections pertaining to
Proserpine and Pluto. The god of vernal sap
and vegetation, of the gladness that comes of
youth or of wine, the golden-curled, sleepy-eyed
Bacchus (Dionysus),&mdash;his wanderings,
and the fortunes of mortals brought under
his influence (Pentheus, Acetes, Ariadne,
and Midas), here challenge our attention.</p>

</div>

<p><b>111. The Wanderings of Bacchus.</b> After
the death of Semele,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Jove took the infant
Bacchus and gave him in charge to the
Nys&aelig;an nymphs, who nourished his infancy
and childhood and for their care were placed
by Jupiter, as the Hyades, among the stars.
Another guardian and tutor of young Bacchus
was the pot-bellied, jovial Silenus, son of
Pan and a nymph, and oldest of the Satyrs.
Silenus was probably an indulgent preceptor.
He was generally tipsy and would have
broken his neck early in his career, had not
the Satyrs held him on his ass's back as he reeled along in the
train of his pupil. After Bacchus was of age, he discovered the
culture of the vine and the mode of extracting its precious juice;
but Juno struck him with madness and drove him forth a wanderer
through various parts of the earth. In Phrygia the goddess
Rhea cured him and taught him her religious rites; and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>he set out on a progress through Asia, teaching the people the
cultivation of the vine. The most famous part of his wanderings
is his expedition to
India, which is said
to have lasted several
years. Returning in
triumph, he undertook
to introduce his worship
into Greece, but
was opposed by certain
princes who dreaded
the disorders and madness
it brought with it.
Finally, he approached
his native city Thebes,
where his own cousin,
Pentheus, son of Agave
and grandson of Harmonia
and Cadmus, was
king. Pentheus, however,
had no respect
for the new worship and forbade its rites to be performed.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> But
when it was known that Bacchus was advancing, men and women,
young and old, poured forth to meet him and to join his triumphal
march.</p>

<p>It was in vain Pentheus remonstrated, commanded, and threatened.
His nearest friends and wisest counselors begged him not to oppose
the god. Their remonstrances only made him the more violent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p><b>112. The Story of Acetes.</b> Soon the attendants returned who
had been dispatched to seize Bacchus. They had succeeded in
taking one of the Bacchanals prisoner, whom, with his hands tied
behind him, they brought before the king. Pentheus, threatening
him with death, commanded him to tell who he was and what these
new rites were that he presumed to celebrate.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/image093.jpg" width="300" height="237" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 84. Satyr and M&aelig;nad with Child Dionysus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The prisoner, unterrified, replied that he was Acetes of M&aelig;onia;
that his parents, being poor, had left him their fisherman's trade,
which he had followed till he had acquired the pilot's art of steering
his course by the
stars. It once happened
that he had
touched at the island
of Dia and had sent
his men ashore for
fresh water. They returned,
bringing with
them a lad of delicate
appearance whom
they had found asleep.
Judging him to be
a noble youth, they
thought to detain him
in the hope of liberal
ransom. But Acetes
suspected that some god was concealed under the youth's exterior,
and asked pardon for the violence done. Whereupon the sailors,
enraged by their lust of gain, exclaimed, "Spare thy prayers for
us!" and, in spite of the resistance offered by Acetes, thrust the
captive youth on board and set sail.</p>

<p>Then Bacchus (for the youth was indeed he), as if shaking off
his drowsiness, asked what the trouble was and whither they were
carrying him. One of the mariners replied, "Fear nothing; tell us
where thou wouldst go, and we will convey thee thither." "Naxos
is my home," said Bacchus; "take me there, and ye shall be well
rewarded." They promised so to do; but, preventing the pilot from
steering toward Naxos, they bore away for Egypt, where they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
sell the lad into slavery. Soon the god looked out over the sea
and said in a voice of weeping, "Sailors, these are not the shores
ye promised me; yonder island is not my home. It is small glory
ye shall gain by cheating a poor boy." Acetes wept to hear him,
but the crew laughed at both of them and sped the vessel fast over
the sea. All at once it stopped in mid-sea, as fast as if it were
fixed on the ground. The men, astonished, pulled at their oars
and spread more sail, but all in vain. Ivy twined round the oars
and clung to the sails,
with heavy clusters of
berries. A vine laden
with grapes ran up
the mast and along
the sides of the vessel.
The sound of flutes was
heard, and the odor of
fragrant wine spread
all around. The god
himself had a chaplet
of vine leaves and
bore in his hand a
spear wreathed with
ivy. Tigers crouched
at his feet, and forms
of lynxes and spotted
panthers played around
him. The whole crew became dolphins and swam about the ship.
Of twenty men Acetes alone was left. "Fear not," said the god;
"steer towards Naxos." The pilot obeyed, and when they arrived
there, kindled the altars and celebrated the sacred rites of Bacchus.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/image094.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 85. Dionysus at Sea</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>So far had Acetes advanced in his narrative, when Pentheus,
interrupting, ordered him off to his death. But from this fate the
pilot, rendered invisible by his patron deity, was straightway rescued.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the mountain Cith&aelig;ron seemed alive with worshipers,
and the cries of the Bacchanals resounded on every side. Pentheus,
angered by the noise, penetrated through the wood and reached an
open space where the chief scene of the orgies met his eyes. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the same moment the women saw him, among them his mother
Agave, and Autono&euml; and Ino, her sisters. Taking him for a wild
boar, they rushed upon him and tore him to pieces,&mdash;his mother
shouting, "Victory! Victory! the glory is ours!"</p>

<p>So the worship of Bacchus was established in Greece.</p>

<p>It was on the island of Naxos that Bacchus afterward found
Ariadne, the daughter of Minos, king of Crete, who had been deserted
by her lover, Theseus. How Bacchus comforted her is related
in another section. How the god himself is worshiped is told by
Edmund Gosse in the poem from which the following extracts are
taken:</p>

<p><b>113. The Choice of King Midas.</b><a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Once Silenus, having wandered
from the company of Bacchus in an intoxicated condition,
was found by some peasants, who carried him to their king, Midas.
Midas entertained him royally and on the eleventh day restored
him in safety to his divine pupil. Whereupon Bacchus offered
Midas his choice of a reward. The king asked that whatever he
might touch should be changed into gold. Bacchus consented.
Midas hastened to put his new-acquired power to the test. A
twig of an oak, which he plucked from the branch, became gold in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>his hand. He took up a stone; it changed to gold. He touched
a sod with the same result. He took an apple from the tree; you
would have thought he had robbed the garden of the Hesperides.
He ordered his servants, then, to set an excellent meal on the
table. But, to his dismay, when he touched bread, it hardened in
his hand; when he put a morsel to his lips, it defied his teeth. He
took a glass of wine, but it flowed down his throat like melted gold.</p>

<p>He strove to divest himself of his power; he hated the gift he
had lately coveted. He raised his arms, all shining with gold, in
prayer to Bacchus, begging to be delivered from this glittering
destruction. The merciful deity heard and sent him to wash away
his fault and its punishment in the fountainhead of the river
Pactolus. Scarce had Midas touched the waters, before the gold-creating
power passed into them, and the river sands became
golden, as they remain to this day.</p>

<p>Thenceforth Midas, hating wealth and splendor, dwelt in the
country and became a worshiper of Pan, the god of the fields.
But that he had not gained common sense is shown by the decision
that he delivered somewhat later in favor of Pan's superiority,
as a musician, over Apollo.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<span class="ph4">FROM THE EARTH TO THE UNDERWORLD</span></h3>


<p><b>114. Myths of Ceres, Pluto, and Proserpine.</b> The search of
Ceres for Proserpine, and of Orpheus for Eurydice, are stories
pertaining both to Earth and Hades.</p>

<p><b>115. The Rape of Proserpine.</b><a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> When the giants were imprisoned
by Jupiter under Mount &AElig;tna, Pluto (Hades) feared lest the
shock of their fall might expose his kingdom to the light of day.
Under this apprehension, he mounted his chariot drawn by black
horses, and made a circuit of inspection to satisfy himself of the
extent of the damage. While he was thus engaged, Venus, who
was sitting on Mount Eryx playing with her boy Cupid, espied
him and said, "My son, take thy darts which subdue all, even Jove
himself, and send one into the breast of yonder dark monarch,
who rules the realm of Tartarus. Dost thou not see that even in
heaven some despise our power? Minerva and Diana defy us; and
there is that daughter of Ceres, goddess of earth, who threatens to
follow their example. Now, if thou regardest thine own interest
or mine, join these two in one." The boy selected his sharpest
and truest arrow, and sped it right to the heart of Pluto.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>
<p>In the vale of Enna is a lake embowered in woods, where Spring
reigns perpetual. Here Proserpine (Persephone) was playing with
her companions, gathering lilies and violets, and singing, one may
imagine, such words as our poet Shelley puts into her mouth:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Pluto saw her, loved her, and carried her off. She screamed for
help to her mother and her companions; but the ravisher urged
on his steeds and outdistanced pursuit. When he reached the
river Cyane, it opposed his passage, whereupon he struck the bank
with his trident, and the earth opened and gave him a passage to
Tartarus.</p>

<p><b>116. The Wanderings of Ceres.</b><a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Ceres (Demeter) sought her
daughter all the world over. Bright-haired Aurora, when she came
forth in the morning, and Hesperus, when he led out the stars in
the evening, found her still busy in the search. At length, weary
and sad, she sat down upon a stone, and remained nine days and
nights in the open air, under the sunlight and moonlight and falling
showers. It was where now stands the city of Eleusis, near the
home of an old man named Celeus. His little girl, pitying the old
woman, said to her, "Mother,"&mdash;and the name was sweet to the
ears of Ceres,&mdash;"why sittest thou here alone upon the rocks?"
The old man begged her to come into his cottage. She declined.
He urged her. "Go in peace," she replied, "and be happy in thy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>daughter; I have lost mine." But their compassion finally prevailed.
Ceres rose from the stone and went with them. As they
walked, Celeus said that his only son lay sick of a fever. The
goddess stooped and gathered some poppies. Then, entering
the cottage, where all was in distress,&mdash;for the boy Triptolemus
seemed past recovery,&mdash;she restored the child to life and
health with a kiss. In
grateful happiness the
family spread the table
and put upon it curds
and cream, apples, and
honey in the comb.
While they ate, Ceres
mingled poppy juice
in the milk of the boy.
When night came, she
arose and, taking the
sleeping boy, molded
his limbs with her
hands, and uttered
over him three times
a solemn charm, then
went and laid him in
the ashes. His mother,
who had been watching
what her guest
was doing, sprang forward
with a cry and
snatched the child from the fire. Then Ceres assumed her own form,
and a divine splendor shone all around. While they were overcome
with astonishment, she said, "Mother, thou hast been cruel in thy
fondness; for I would have made thy son immortal. Nevertheless,
he shall be great and useful. He shall teach men the use of the plow
and the rewards which labor can win from the soil." So saying, she
wrapped a cloud about her and mounting her chariot rode away.</p>

<p>Ceres continued her search for her daughter till at length she
returned to Sicily, whence she first had set out, and stood by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
banks of the river Cyane. The river nymph would have told the
goddess all she had witnessed, but dared not, for fear of Pluto;
so she ventured merely to take up the girdle which Proserpine had
dropped in her flight, and float it to the feet of the mother. Ceres,
seeing this, laid her curse on the innocent earth in which her
daughter had disappeared. Then succeeded drought and famine,
flood and plague, until, at last, the fountain Arethusa made intercession
for the land. For she had seen that it opened only unwillingly
to the might of Pluto; and she had also, in her flight from
Alphe&uuml;s through the lower regions of the earth, beheld the missing
Proserpine. She said that the daughter of Ceres seemed sad,
but no longer showed alarm in her countenance. Her look was
such as became a queen,&mdash;the queen of Erebus; the powerful
bride of the monarch of the realms of the dead.</p>

</div>

<p>When Ceres heard this, she stood awhile like one stupefied;
then she implored Jupiter to interfere to procure the restitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of her daughter. Jupiter consented on condition that Proserpine
should not during her stay in the lower world have taken any food;
otherwise, the Fates forbade her release. Accordingly, Mercury
was sent, accompanied by Spring, to demand Proserpine of Pluto.
The wily monarch consented; but alas! the maiden had taken a
pomegranate which Pluto offered her, and had sucked the sweet
pulp from a few of the seeds. A compromise, however, was effected
by which she was to pass half the time with her mother, and the
rest with the lord of Hades.</p>

<p>Of modern poems upon the story of the maiden seized in the
vale of Enna, none conveys a lesson more serene of the beauty of
that dark lover of all fair life, Death, than the Proserpine of Woodberry,
from which we quote the three following stanzas. "I pick,"
says the poet wandering through the vale of Enna,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

with this arrangement, restored the earth to her favor. Now she

who have visited
Hades and returned,
none has a sweeter or
sadder history than Orpheus,
son of Apollo
and the Muse Calliope.
Presented by his father
with a lyre and taught
to play upon it, he became
the most famous
of musicians, and not
only his fellow mortals
but even the wild
beasts were softened
by his strains. The
very trees and rocks
were sensible to the
charm. And so also was Eurydice,&mdash;whom he loved and won.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 93. Orpheus and Eurydice</span></p>

<p>From the painting by Lord Leighton</p></div>
</div>

<p>Hymen was called to bless with his presence the nuptials of
Orpheus with Eurydice, but he conveyed no happy omens with
him. His torch smoked and brought tears into the eyes. In keeping
with such sad prognostics, Eurydice, shortly after her marriage,
was seen by the shepherd Arist&aelig;us, who was struck with her beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>and made advances to her. As she fled she trod upon a snake in
the grass, and was bitten in the foot. She died. Orpheus sang his
grief to all who breathed the upper air, both gods and men, and
finding his complaint of no avail, resolved to seek his wife in the
regions of the dead. He descended by a cave situated on the side
of the promontory of T&aelig;narus, and arrived in the Stygian realm.
He passed through crowds
of ghosts and presented
himself before the throne
of Pluto and Proserpine.
Accompanying his words
with the lyre, he sang his
petition for his wife. Without
her he would not return.
In such tender strains
he sang that the very ghosts
shed tears. Tantalus, in
spite of his thirst, stopped
for a moment his efforts for
water, Ixion's wheel stood
still, the vulture ceased to
tear the giant's liver, the
daughters of Dana&uuml;s rested
from their task of drawing
water in a sieve, and Sisyphus
sat on his rock to
listen.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Then for the first
time, it is said, the cheeks
of the Furies were wet with tears. Proserpine could not resist and
Pluto himself gave way. Eurydice was called. She came from among
the new-arrived ghosts, limping with her wounded foot. Orpheus
was permitted to take her away with him on condition that he should
not turn round to look at her till they should have reached the upper
air. Under this condition they proceeded on their way, he leading,
she following. Mindful of his promise, without let or hindrance the
bard passed through the horrors of hell. All Hades held its breath.</p>

<p>The Thracian maidens tried their best to captivate him, but he
repulsed their advances. Finally, excited by the rites of Bacchus,
one of them exclaimed, "See yonder our despiser!" and threw
at him her javelin. The weapon, as soon as it came within the
sound of his lyre, fell harmless at his feet; so also the stones that
they threw at him. But the women, raising a scream, drowned
the voice of the music, and overwhelmed him with their missiles.
Like maniacs they tore him limb from limb; then cast his head
and lyre into the river Hebrus, down which they floated, murmuring
sad music to which the shores responded. The Muses buried
the fragments of his body at Libethra, where the nightingale is
said to sing over his grave more sweetly than in any other part of
Greece. His lyre was placed by Jupiter among the stars; but the
shade of the bard passed a second time to Tartarus and rejoined
Eurydice.</p>

<span class="ph4">MYTHS OF NEPTUNE, RULER OF THE WATERS</span></h3>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 95. Poseidon</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><b>119. Lord of the Sea.</b> Neptune (Poseidon) was lord both of salt
waters and of fresh. The myths that turn on his life as lord of the
sea illustrate his defiant invasions
of lands belonging to other gods, or
his character as earth shaker and
earth protector. Of his contests
with other gods, that with Minerva
for Athens has been related. He
contested Corinth with Helios,
Argos with Juno, &AElig;gina with
Jove, Naxos with Bacchus, and
Delphi with Apollo. That he did
not always make encroachments
in person upon the land that he
desired to possess or to punish,
but sent some monster instead,
will be seen in the myth of Andromeda<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
and in the following
story of Hesione,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> the daughter of
Laomedon of Troy.</p>

<p>Neptune and Apollo had fallen
under the displeasure of Jupiter
after the overthrow of the giants.
They were compelled, it is said,
to resign for a season their respective functions and to serve
Laomedon, then about to build the city of Troy. They aided the
king in erecting the walls of the city but were refused the wages
agreed upon. Justly offended, Neptune ravaged the land by floods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>and sent against it a sea monster, to satiate the appetite of which
the desperate Laomedon was driven to offer his daughter Hesione.
But Hercules appeared upon the scene, killed the monster, and
rescued the maiden. Neptune, however, nursed his wrath; and it
was still warm when the Greeks marched against Troy.</p>

<p>Of a like impetuous and ungovernable temper were the sons of
Neptune by mortal mothers. From him were sprung the savage
L&aelig;strygonians, Orion, the Cyclops Polyphemus, the giant Ant&aelig;us
whom Hercules slew, Procrustes, and many another redoubtable
being whose fortunes are elsewhere recounted.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p><b>120. Lord of Streams and Fountains.</b> As earth shaker, the ruler
of the deep was known to effect convulsions of nature that made
Pluto leap from his throne lest the firmament of the underworld
might be falling about his ears. But as god of the streams and fountains,
Neptune displayed milder characteristics. When Amymone,
sent by her father Dana&uuml;s to draw water, was pursued by a satyr,
Neptune gave ear to her cry for help, dispatched the satyr, made
love to the maiden, and boring the earth with his trident called
forth the spring that still bears the Dana&iuml;d's name. He loved the
goddess Ceres also, through whose pastures his rivers strayed; and
Arne the shepherdess, daughter of King &AElig;olus, by whom he
became the forefather of the B&oelig;otians. His children, Pelias and
Neleus, by the princess Tyro, whom he wooed in the form of her
lover Enipeus, became keepers of horses&mdash;animals especially dear
to Neptune. Perhaps it was the similarity of horse-taming to wave-taming
that attracted the god to these quadrupeds; perhaps it was
because they increased in beauty and speed on the pastures watered
by his streams. It is said, indeed, that the first and fleetest of
horses, Arion, was the offspring of Neptune and Ceres, or of Neptune
and a Fury.</p>

<p><b>121. Pelops and Hippodamia.</b><a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> To Pelops, brother of Niobe,
Neptune imparted skill in training and driving horses,&mdash;and with
good effect. For it happened that Pelops fell in love with Hippodamia,
daughter of &OElig;noma&uuml;s, king of Elis and son of Mars,&mdash;a
girl of whom it was reported that none could win her save by
worsting the father in a chariot race, and that none might fail in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>that race and come off alive. Since an oracle, too, had warned
&OElig;noma&uuml;s to beware of the future husband of his daughter, he had
provided himself with horses whose speed was like the cyclone.
But Pelops, obtaining from Neptune winged steeds, entered the
race and won it,&mdash;whether by the speed of his horses or by the
aid of Hippodamia, who, it is said, bribed her father's charioteer,
Myrtilus, to take a bolt out of the chariot of &OElig;noma&uuml;s, is uncertain.
At any rate, Pelops married Hippodamia. He was so injudicious,
however, as to throw Myrtilus into the sea; and from that
treachery sprang the misfortunes of the house of Pelops. For
Myrtilus, dying, cursed the murderer and his race.</p>

<p><b>123. Cephalus and Procris.</b><a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Aurora, the goddess of the dawn,
fell in love with Cephalus, a young huntsman. She stole him away,
lavished her love upon him, tried to content him, but in vain. He
cared for his young wife Procris more than for the goddess. Finally,
Aurora dismissed him in displeasure, saying, "Go, ungrateful mortal,
keep thy wife; but thou shalt one day be sorry that thou didst
ever see her again."</p>

<p>Cephalus returned and was as happy as before in his wife. She,
being a favorite of Diana, had received from her for the chase a
dog and a javelin, which she handed over to her husband. Of
the dog it is told that when about to catch the swiftest fox in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>the country, he was changed with his victim into stone. For the
heavenly powers, who had made both and rejoiced in the speed
of both, were not willing that either should conquer. The javelin
was destined to a sad office. It appears that Cephalus, when
weary of the chase, was wont to stretch himself in a certain shady
nook to enjoy the breeze. Sometimes he would say aloud, "Come,
gentle Aura, sweet goddess of the breeze, come and allay the heat
that burns me." Some one, foolishly believing that he addressed
a maiden, told the secret to Procris. Hoping against hope, she
stole out after him the next morning and concealed herself in the
place which the informer had indicated. Cephalus, when tired with
sport, stretched himself on the green bank and summoned fair
Aura as usual. Suddenly he heard, or thought he heard, a sound as
of a sob in the bushes. Supposing it to proceed from some wild
animal, he threw his javelin at the spot. A cry told him that the
weapon had too surely met its mark. He rushed to the place
and raised his wounded Procris from the earth. She, at last,
opened her feeble eyes and forced herself to utter these words:
"I implore thee, if thou hast ever loved me, if I have ever deserved
kindness at thy hands, my husband, grant me this last
request; marry not that odious Breeze!" So saying, she expired
in her lover's arms.</p>

the story is given in the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Procris, the nymph, had wedded Cephalus;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He, till the spring had warmed to slow-winged days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy with June, untired and amorous,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Named her his love; but now, in unknown ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart was gone; and evermore his gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Turned from her own, and even farther ranged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His woodland war; while she, in dull amaze,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Sighed for his lost caress, by some hard god estranged.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, on a day, she rose and found him not.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alone, with wet, sad eye, she watched the shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brighten below a soft-rayed sun that shot<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Arrows of light through all the deep-leaved glade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, with weak hands, she knotted up the braid<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of her brown hair, and o'er her shoulders cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her crimson weed; with faltering fingers made<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her golden girdle's clasp to join, and past<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Down to the trackless wood, full pale and overcast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And all day long her slight spear devious flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And harmless swerved her arrows from their aim,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For ever, as the ivory bow she drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before her ran the still unwounded game.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, at the last, a hunter's cry there came,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, lo! a hart that panted with the chase.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat her cheek was lightened as with flame,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Leaping he went, this hunter Cephalus,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bent in his hand his cornel bow he bare,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><b>125. Ceyx and Halcyone.</b> The son of Aurora and Cephalus was
Phosphor, the Star of Morning. His son Ceyx, king of Trachis in
Thessaly, had married Halcyone, daughter of &AElig;olus.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Their reign
was happy until the brother of Ceyx met his death. The direful
prodigies that followed this event made Ceyx feel that the gods
were hostile to him. He thought best therefore to make a voyage
to Claros in Ionia to consult the oracle of Apollo. In spite of his
wife's entreaties (for as daughter of the god of winds she knew
how dreadful a thing a storm at sea was), Ceyx set sail. He was
shipwrecked and drowned. His last prayer was that the waves
might bear his body to the sight of Halcyone, and that it might
receive burial at her hands.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>In the meanwhile, Halcyone counted the days till her husband's
promised return. To all the gods she offered frequent incense, but
more than all to Juno. The goddess, at last, could not bear to be
further pleaded with for one already dead. Calling Iris, she enjoined
her to approach the drowsy dwelling of Somnus and bid him send
a vision to Halcyone in the form of Ceyx, to reveal the sad event.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 220px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 100. The God of Sleep</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Iris puts on her robe of many
colors, and tinging the sky with her
bow, seeks the cave near the Cimmerian
country, which is the abode
of the dull god, Somnus. Here
Ph&oelig;bus dare not come. Clouds
and shadows are exhaled from the
ground, and the light glimmers
faintly. The cock never there calls
aloud to Aurora, nor watchdog nor
goose disturbs the silence. No wild
beast, nor cattle, nor branch moved
with the wind, nor sound of human
conversation breaks the stillness.
From the bottom of the rock the
river Lethe flows, and by its murmur
invites to sleep. Poppies grow before
the door of the cave, from whose
juices Night distills slumbers which
she scatters over the darkened earth.
There is no gate to creak on its
hinges, nor any watchman. In the
midst, on a couch of black ebony adorned with black plumes and
black curtains the god reclines, his limbs relaxed in sleep. Around
him lie dreams, resembling all various forms, as many as the harvest
bears stalks, or the forest leaves, or the seashore sand grains.</p>

<p>Brushing away the dreams that hovered around her, Iris lit up
the cave and delivered her message to the god, who, scarce opening
his eyes, had great difficulty in shaking himself free from himself.</p>

<p>Then Iris hasted away from the drowsiness creeping over her,
and returned by her bow as she had come. But Somnus called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
one of his sons, Morpheus, the most expert in counterfeiting forms
of men, to perform the command of Iris; then laid his head on
his pillow and yielded himself again to grateful repose.</p>

<p>Morpheus flew on silent wings to the H&aelig;monian city, where he
assumed the form of Ceyx. Pale like a dead man, naked and dripping,
he stood before the couch of the wretched wife and told her
that the winds of the &AElig;gean had sunk his ship, that he was dead.</p>

<p>Weeping and groaning, Halcyone sprang from sleep and, with
the dawn, hastening to the seashore, descried an indistinct object
washed to and fro by the waves. As it floated nearer she recognized
the body of her husband. In despair, leaping from the mole,
she was changed instantly to a bird, and poured forth a song of
grief as she flew. By the mercy of the gods Ceyx was likewise
transformed. For seven days before and seven days after the winter
solstice, Jove forbids the winds to blow. Then Halcyone broods
over her nest; then the way is safe to seafarers. &AElig;olus confines
the winds that his grandchildren may have peace.</p>

<p><b>126. Aurora and Tithonus.</b><a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Aurora seems frequently to have
been inspired with the love of mortals. Her greatest favorite, and
almost her latest, was Tithonus, son of Laomedon, king of Troy.
She stole him away and prevailed on Jupiter to grant him immortality;
but forgetting to have youth joined in the gift, after some time
she began to discern, to her great mortification, that he was growing
old. When his hair was white she left his society; but he still
had the range of her palace, lived on ambrosial food, and was clad
in celestial raiment. In time he lost the power of using his limbs;
and then she shut him up in his chamber, whence his feeble voice
might at times be heard. Finally, she turned him into a grasshopper.</p>

<p><b>127. Tennyson's Tithonus.</b> The following is, according to a fine
poetic conception, the lament of the old man when but a white-haired

<p><b>128. Memnon</b>, the son of Aurora and Tithonus, was king of the
&AElig;thiopians. He went with warriors to assist his kindred in the
Trojan War, and was received by King Priam with honor. He
fought bravely, slew Antilochus, the brave son of Nestor, and held
the Greeks at bay until Achilles appeared. Before that hero he fell.</p>

<p>Then Aurora, seeing her son's fate, directed his brothers, the
Winds, to convey his body to the banks of the river &AElig;sepus in
Mysia. In the evening Aurora, accompanied by the Hours and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the Pleiads, bewept her son. Night spread the heaven with clouds;
all nature mourned for the offspring of the Dawn. The &AElig;thiopians
raised his tomb on the banks of the stream in the grove of
the Nymphs, and Jupiter
caused the sparks and
cinders of his funeral pile
to be turned into birds,
which, dividing into two
flocks, fought over the
pile till they fell into the
flame. Every year at
the anniversary of his
death they celebrated his
obsequies in like manner.

<span class="ph4">MYTHS OF THE LESSER DIVINITIES OF EARTH, ETC.</span></h3>


<p><b>129. Pan, and the Personification of Nature.</b> It was a pleasing
trait in the old paganism that it loved to trace in every operation of
nature the agency of deity. The imagination of the Greeks peopled
the regions of earth and sea with divinities, to whose agency it
attributed the phenomena that our philosophy ascribes to the operation
of natural law. So Pan, the god of woods and fields,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> whose
name seemed to signify <i>all</i>, came to be considered a symbol of
the universe and a personification of Nature. "Universal Pan,"
says Milton in his description of the creation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">Universal Pan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led on the eternal Spring.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Later, Pan came to be regarded as a representative of all the
Greek gods and of paganism itself. Indeed, according to an early
Christian tradition, when the heavenly host announced to the shepherds
the birth of Christ, a deep groan, heard through the isles of
Greece, told that great Pan was dead, that the dynasty of Olympus
was dethroned, and the several deities sent wandering in cold and
darkness.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The lonely mountains o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the resounding shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Edged with poplar pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The parting Genius is with sighing sent;<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Many a poet has lamented the change. For even if the head
did profit for a time by the revolt against the divine prerogative
of nature, it is more than possible that the heart lost in due
proportion.</p>

<p>His sorrow at this loss of imaginative sympathy among the
moderns Wordsworth expresses in the sonnet, already cited, beginning
"The world is too much with us." Schiller, also, by his
poem, The Gods of Greece, has immortalized his sorrow for the
decadence of the ancient mythology.</p>

<p><b>131. Other Lesser Gods of Earth.</b> Of the company of the
lesser gods of earth, besides Pan, were the Sileni, the Sylvans,
the Fauns, and the Satyrs, all male; the
Oreads and the Dryads or Hamadryads,
female. To these may be added the
Naiads, for, although they dwelt in the
streams, their association with the deities
of earth was intimate. Of the nymphs,
the Oreads and the Naiads were immortal.
The love of Pan for Syrinx has
already been mentioned, and his musical
contest with Apollo. Of Silenus we have
seen something in the adventures of
Bacchus. What kind of existence the
Satyr enjoyed is conveyed in the following

<p><b>132. Echo and Narcissus.</b><a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Echo was a beautiful Oread, fond of
the woods and hills, a favorite of Diana, whom she attended in the
chase. But by her chatter she came under the displeasure of Juno,
who condemned her to the loss of voice save for purposes of reply.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 184px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 109. Narcissus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Subsequently having fallen in love with Narcissus, the beautiful
son of the river-god Cephissus, Echo found it impossible to express
her regard for him in any way but by mimicking what he said;
and what he said, unfortunately, did not always convey her sentiments.
When, however, he once called across the hills to her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>"Let us join one another," the maid, answering with all her heart,
hastened to the spot, ready to throw her arms about his neck. He
started back, exclaiming, "Hands off! I would rather die than
thou shouldst have me!" "Have me," said she; but in vain.
From that time forth she lived in caves and among mountain cliffs,
and faded away till there was nothing left of her but her voice. But
through his future fortunes she was constant to her cruel lover.</p>

<p>This Narcissus was the embodiment of self-conceit. He shunned
the rest of the nymphs as he had shunned Echo. One maiden,
however, uttered a prayer that he might some time or other feel
what it was to love and meet no return of affection. The avenging
goddess heard. Narcissus, stooping over a river brink, fell in love
with his own image in the water. He talked to it, tried to embrace
it, languished for it, and pined until he died. Indeed, even after
death, it is said that when his shade passed the Stygian river it
leaned over the boat to catch a look of itself in the waters. The
nymphs mourned for Narcissus, especially the water-nymphs; and
when they smote their breasts, Echo smote hers also. They prepared
a funeral pile and would have burned the body, but it was
nowhere to be found. In its place had sprung up a flower, purple
within and surrounded with white leaves, which bears the name
and preserves the memory of the son of Cephissus.</p>

<p><b>135. The Dryads</b>, or <b>Hamadryads</b>, assumed at times the forms
of peasant girls, shepherdesses, or followers of the hunt. But they
were believed to perish with certain trees which had been their
abode and with which they had come into existence. Wantonly to
destroy a tree was therefore an impious act, sometimes severely
punished, as in the cases of Erysichthon and Dryope.</p>

<p><b>136. Erysichthon</b>,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> a despiser of the gods, presumed to violate
with the ax a grove sacred to Ceres. A venerable oak, whereon
votive tablets had often been hung inscribed with the gratitude
of mortals to the nymph of the tree,&mdash;an oak round which the
Dryads hand in hand had often danced,&mdash;he ordered his servants
to fell. When he saw them hesitate, he snatched an ax from one,
and boasting that he cared not whether it were a tree beloved of
the goddess or not, addressed himself to the task. The oak seemed
to shudder and utter a groan. When the first blow fell upon the
trunk, blood flowed from the wound. Warned by a bystander to
desist, Erysichthon slew him; warned by a voice from the nymph
of the tree, he redoubled his blows and brought down the oak.
The Dryads invoked punishment upon Erysichthon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>The goddess Ceres, whom they had supplicated, nodded her
assent. She dispatched an Oread to ice-clad Scythia, where Cold
abides, and Fear and Shuddering and Famine. At Mount Caucasus,
the Oread stayed the dragons of Ceres that drew her chariot;
for afar off she beheld Famine, forespent with hunger, pulling up
with teeth and claws the scanty herbage from a stony field. To her
the nymph delivered the commands of Ceres, then returned in
haste to Thessaly, for she herself began to be an hungered.</p>

<p>The orders of Ceres were executed by Famine, who, speeding
through the air, entered the dwelling of Erysichthon and, as he
slept, enfolded him with her wings and breathed herself into him.
In his dreams the caitiff craved food; and when he awoke, his
hunger raged. The more he ate, the more he craved, till, in
default of money, he sold his daughter into slavery for edibles.
Neptune, however, rescued the girl by changing her into a fisherman;
and in that form she assured the slave-owner that she had
seen no woman or other person, except herself, thereabouts. Then,
resuming her own appearance, she was again and again sold by her
father; while by Neptune's favor she became on each occasion a
different animal, and so regained her home. Finally, increasing
demands of hunger compelled the father to devour his own limbs;
and in due time he finished himself off.</p>

<p><b>137. Dryope</b>, the wife of Andr&aelig;mon, purposing with her sister
Iole to gather flowers for the altars of the nymphs, plucked the
purple blossoms of a lotus plant that grew near the water, and
offered them to her child. Iole, about to do the same thing, perceived
that the stem of the plant was bleeding. Indeed, the plant
was none other than a nymph, Lotis, who, escaping from a base
pursuer, had been thus transformed.</p>

<p>Dryope would have hastened from the spot, but the displeasure
of the nymph had fallen upon her. While protesting her innocence,
she began to put forth branches and leaves. Praying her
husband to see that no violence was done to her, to remind their
child that every flower or bush might be a goddess in disguise, to
bring him often to be nursed under her branches, and to teach
him to say "My mother lies hid under this bark,"&mdash;the luckless
woman assumed the shape of a lotus.</p>

<p>Rh&oelig;cus, happening to see an oak just ready to fall, propped
it up. The nymph, who had been on the point of perishing with
the tree, expressed her gratitude to him and bade him ask what
reward he would. Rh&oelig;cus boldly asked her love, and the nymph
yielded to his desire. At the same time charging him to be mindful
and constant, she promised to expect him an hour before sunset
and, meanwhile, to communicate with him by means of her messenger,&mdash;a
bee:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Now, in those days of simpleness and faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men did not think that happy things were dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they overstepped the narrow bourn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of likelihood, but reverently deemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing too wondrous or too beautiful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be the guerdon of a daring heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Rh&oelig;cus made no doubt that he was blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all along unto the city's gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth seemed to spring beneath him as he walked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clear, broad sky looked bluer than its wont,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he could scarce believe he had not wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such sunshine seemed to glitter through his veins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of blood, so light he felt and strange.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the day was past its noon. Joining some comrades over the
dice, Rh&oelig;cus forgot all else. A bee buzzed about his ear. Impatiently
he brushed it aside:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then through the window flew the wounded bee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Rh&oelig;cus, tracking him with angry eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw a sharp mountain peak of Thessaly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the red disk of the setting sun,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And instantly the blood sank from his heart....<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">... Quite spent and out of breath he reached the tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, listening fearfully, he heard once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The low voice murmur, "Rh&oelig;cus!" close at hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat he looked around him, but could see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naught but the deepening glooms beneath the oak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sighed the voice, "O Rh&oelig;cus! nevermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt thou behold me or by day or night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me, who would fain have blessed thee with a love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More ripe and bounteous than ever yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled up with nectar any mortal heart:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We ever ask an undivided love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he who scorns the least of Nature's works<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is thenceforth exiled and shut out from all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell! for thou canst never see me more."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then Rh&oelig;cus beat his breast, and groaned aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried, "Be pitiful! forgive me yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This once, and I shall never need it more!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Alas!" the voice returned, "'tis thou art blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not I unmerciful; I can forgive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But have no skill to heal thy spirit's eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the soul hath power o'er itself."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that again there murmured, "Nevermore!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Rh&oelig;cus after heard no other sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except the rattling of the oak's crisp leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the long surf upon a distant shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raking the sea-worn pebbles up and down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The night had gathered round him: o'er the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The city sparkled with its thousand lights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sounds of revel fell upon his ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harshly and like a curse; above, the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all its bright sublimity of stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deepened, and on his forehead smote the breeze:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty was all around him and delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from that eve he was alone on earth.<br /></span>

<p>According to the older tradition, the nymph deprived Rh&oelig;cus
of his physical sight; but the superior insight of Lowell's interpretation
is evident.</p>

<p>This nymph had scorned the offers of love made her by Pan,
Sylvanus, and innumerable Fauns and Satyrs. Vertumnus, too,
she had time and again refused. But he, the
deity of gardens and of the changing seasons,
unwearied, wooed her in as many guises as
his seasons themselves could assume. Now
as a reaper, now as haymaker, now as plowman,
now as vinedresser, now as apple-picker,
now as fisherman, now as soldier,&mdash;all to no
avail. Finally, as an old woman, he came to
her, admired her fruit, admired especially the
luxuriance of her grapes, descanted on the
dependence of the luxuriant vine, close by,
upon the elm to which it was clinging;
advised Pomona, likewise, to choose some
youth&mdash;say, for instance, the young Vertumnus&mdash;about
whom to twine <i>her</i> arms. Then
he told how the worthy Iphis, spurned by
Anaxarete, had hanged himself to her gatepost;
and how the gods had turned the hard-hearted virgin to stone
even as she gazed on her lover's funeral. "Consider these things,
dearest child," said the seeming old woman, "lay aside thy scorn
and thy delays, and accept a lover. So may neither the vernal frosts
blight thy young fruits, nor furious winds scatter thy blossoms!"</p>

<p>When Vertumnus had thus spoken, he dropped his disguise
and stood before Pomona in his proper person,&mdash;a comely youth.
Such wooing, of course, could not but win its just reward.</p>

(the terrible ones), Erinyes (the persecutors, or the angered ones),
and finally, by way of euphemism, Eumenides (the well-meaning),

filial disobedience, irreverence to old age, perjury, murder, treachery
to guests, even unkindness toward beggars. They avenged the
ghosts of such as, dying violent deaths, possessed on earth no representatives
either by law or by kindred to avenge them. Therefore,
as we shall see, they persecuted Orestes, who had slain his
mother. Therefore, like the accusing voice
of conscience, they marshaled to punishment
the murderers of Ibycus.</p>

<p>This poet, beloved of Apollo, was, while
journeying to the musical contest of the
Isthmus at Corinth, attacked by two robbers
in the Corinthian grove of Neptune. Overcome
by them, he commended his cause as
he fell to a flock of cranes that happened
to be screaming hoarsely overhead. But
when his body was found, all Greece, then
gathered at the festival, demanded vengeance
on the murderer.</p>

<p>Soon afterward, the vast assemblage in
the amphitheater sat listening to a play in
which the Chorus personated the Furies.
The Choristers, clad in black, bore in their fleshless hands torches
blazing with a pitchy flame. Advancing with measured step, they
formed ranks in the orchestra. Their cheeks were bloodless, and
in place of hair writhing serpents curled around their brows.
Forming a circle, these awful beings sang their hymn. High it
swelled, overpowering the sound of the instruments:</p>

<p>"Happy the man whose heart is pure from guilt and crime!
Him we avengers touch not; he treads the path of life secure
from us. But woe! woe! to him who has done the deed of secret
murder. We, the fearful brood of Night, fasten ourselves upon
him, soul and flesh. Thinks he by flight to escape us? Fly we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>still faster in pursuit, twine our snakes around his feet, and bring him
to the ground. Unwearied we pursue; no pity checks our course;
still on, still on to the end of life, we give no peace, no rest."</p>

<p>Stillness like the stillness of death sat over the assembly. Suddenly
a cry burst from one of the uppermost benches,&mdash;"Lo,
comrade, the avengers of Ibycus!" A flock of cranes crossed the
sky. "The murderer has informed against himself," shouted the
assemblage. The inference was correct. The criminals, straightway
seized, confessed the crime and suffered the penalty.</p>

<span class="ph4">MYTHS OF LESSER DIVINITIES OF THE WATERS</span></h3>


<p><b>141. Galatea and Polyphemus.</b> The water-gods may be roughly
classed as dwellers in the sea and dwellers in the streams. Of the
former, daughters of Nereus and Doris, none was fairer than Galatea,
sister of Amphitrite and Thetis. She loved Acis, the son of
Faunus by a Naiad, and was loved in return; but her happiness
was disturbed and finally ruined by the persistent and jealous attentions
of the Cyclops Polyphemus.</p>

<p>For the first time in his life the Cyclops began to care for his
appearance; he harrowed his coarse locks with a currycomb, mowed
his beard with a sickle, and, looking into the sea when it was calm,
soliloquized, "Beautiful seems my beard, beautiful my one eye,&mdash;as
I count beauty,&mdash;and the sea reflects the gleam of my teeth
whiter than the Parian stone."<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... He loved, not with apples, not roses, nor locks of hair, but with fatal
frenzy; and all things else he held but trifles by the way. Many a time from
the green pastures would his ewes stray back, self-shepherded, to the fold.
But he was singing of Galatea; and pining in his place, he sat by the seaweed
of the beach from the dawn of day with the direst hurt beneath his
breast of mighty Cypris' sending,&mdash;the wound of her arrow in his heart!</p>

<p>Yet this remedy he found, and sitting on the crest of the tall cliff and
looking to the deep, 'twas thus he would sing:</p>

<p>"Oh, milk-white Galatea, why cast off him that loves thee? More white
than is pressed milk to look upon, more delicate than the lamb art thou, than
the young calf wantoner, more sleek than the unripened grape! Here dost
thou resort, even so, when sweet sleep possesses me, and home straightway
dost thou depart when sweet sleep lets me go, fleeing me like an ewe that
has seen the gray wolf. I fell in love with thee, maiden, I, on the day when
first thou camest, with my mother, and didst wish to pluck the hyacinths from
the hill, and I was thy guide on the way. But to leave loving thee when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>once I had seen thee, neither afterward, nor now at all, have I the strength,
even from that hour. But to thee all this is as nothing, by Zeus, nay, nothing
at all!</p>

<p>"I know, thou gracious maiden, why it is that thou dost shun me. It is
all for the shaggy brow that spans my forehead, from this to the other ear,
one long, unbroken eyebrow. And but one eye is on my forehead, and broad
is the nose that overhangs my lip. Yet I (even such as thou seest me) feed a
thousand cattle, and from these I draw
and drink the best milk in the world.
And cheese I never lack, in summer time
or autumn, nay, nor in the dead of winter,
but my baskets are always overladen.</p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Also I am skilled in piping, as none
other of the Cyclopes here, and of thee,
my love, my sweet apple, and of myself,
too, I sing, many a time, deep in the night.
And for thee I tend eleven fawns, all crescent
browed, and four young whelps of the
bear. Nay, come thou to me and thou shalt
lack nothing that now thou hast....</p>

<p>"But if thou dost refuse because my
body seems shaggy and rough, well, I have
faggots of oak-wood, and beneath the ashes
is fire unwearied, and I would endure to let
thee burn my very soul, and this my one
eye, the dearest thing that is mine.</p>

<p>"Ah me, that my mother bore me not
a finny thing, so would I have gone down
to thee, and kissed thy hand, if thy lips
thou would not suffer me to kiss! And
I would have brought thee either white
lilies or the soft poppy with its scarlet petals. Nay, these are summer's
flowers, and those are flowers of winter, so I could not have brought thee
them all at one time.</p>

<p>"Now, verily, maiden, now and here will I learn to swim, if perchance
some stranger come hither, sailing with his ship, that I may see why it is so
dear to thee to have thy dwelling in the deep. Come forth, Galatea, and
forget as thou comest, even as I that sit here have forgotten, the homeward
way!...</p>

<p>"Oh, Cyclops, Cyclops, whither are thy wits wandering? Ah, that thou
wouldst go and weave thy wickerwork and gather broken boughs to carry to
thy lambs: in faith, if thou didst this, far wiser wouldst thou be!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
<p>"Milk the ewe that thou hast; why pursue the thing that shuns thee?
Thou wilt find, perchance, another, and a fairer, Galatea. Many be the girls
that bid me stay with them, and softly they all laugh, if perchance I answer
them. On land it is plain that I, too, seem to be somebody!"<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p></div>

<p>Having, one day, in such wise sung, Polyphemus wandered,
beside himself for passion, into the woods. On a sudden he came
in sight of Galatea and Acis in the hollow of a rock, where they
had hearkened to the strains of the Cyclops. The monster, infuriate,
crying that this should be the last of
their love-meetings, overwhelmed his
rival with a tremendous rock. Purple
blood spirted from under the stone, by
degrees grew paler, and finally became
the stream that still bears the name of
the unfortunate youth. But Galatea remained
inconsolable.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

of that Sisyphus who was punished in
Hades for his treachery to the gods.
Glaucus had been a comely young fisherman;
but having noticed that a certain
herb revived fishes after they were
brought to land, he ate of it and suffered
metamorphosis into something new and strange, half man, half
fish, and after the fashion of a sea-god. Of his experience during
this "sea change" the following is an account:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I plunged for life or death. To interknit<br /></span>

<p>He became guardian of fishes and divers and of those who go
down to the sea in ships. Later, being infatuated of the fair virgin
Scylla (daughter of the sea-god Phorcys and granddaughter of
Pontus), he paid his court to her, but the maiden rejected him.
Whereupon, in desperation, Glaucus sought the aid of Circe, an
enchantress. She, because she coveted for herself the handsome
sea-green god, transformed her rival into a monster hideously
fashioned of serpents and barking dogs.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> In this shape Scylla
thereafter infested the shore of Sicily and worked evil to mariners,<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
till finally she was petrified as a reef, none the less perilous to
all seafarers.</p>

<p>A modern version of the fate of Glaucus and Scylla is given by
Keats in the Endymion. Glaucus consents to Circe's blandishments
for a season, but becoming disgusted with her treachery
and cruelty, he endeavors to escape from her. The attempt proving
unsuccessful, he is brought back and sentenced to pass a
thousand years in decrepitude and pain. Consequently, returning
to the sea, he there discovers the body of Scylla, whom the goddess
has not transformed, but drowned, and learns that if he
passes his thousand years in collecting the bodies of drowned
lovers, a youth beloved of the gods will, in time, appear and help
him. This prophecy is fulfilled by Endymion, who aids in restoring
Glaucus to youth, and Scylla and the drowned lovers to life.</p>

<p><b>143. Nisus and Scylla.</b><a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The daughter of Phorcys is frequently
confounded with another Scylla, daughter of King Nisus
of Megara. Scylla of Megara betrayed her father to his enemy,
Minos II of Crete, with whom, although the kings were at war,
she had fallen violently in love. It seems that Nisus had on his
head a purple lock of hair, upon which depended his fortune and
his life. This lock his daughter clipped and conveyed to Minos.
But recoiling from the treacherous gift, that king, after he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>conquered Megara, bound Scylla to the rudder of his ship and so
dragged her through the waves toward Crete. The girl was ultimately
transformed into the monster of the barking dogs, or, according
to another authority, into a bird continually the prey of
the sea eagle, whose form her father Nisus had assumed.</p>

<p><b>144. Leucothea.</b><a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Another sea change was that of Ino, the
daughter of Cadmus and wife of Athamas, who, flying from her
frantic husband, sprang, with her child Melicertes in her arms,
from a cliff into the sea. The gods, out of compassion, made her
a goddess of the sea under the name of Leucothea, and her son
a god under that of Pal&aelig;mon. Both were held powerful to save
from shipwreck and were invoked by sailors. Pal&aelig;mon was usually
represented as riding on a dolphin. In his honor the Isthmian
games were celebrated. By the Romans he was called Portumnus,
and had jurisdiction of ports and shores.</p>

<p><b>145. Proteus and Arist&aelig;us.</b><a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Though Arist&aelig;us, the lover of
Eurydice, was son of Apollo and guardian himself of herds and
flocks, protector of vine and olive, and keeper of bees, still he
was son of Cyrene, a water-nymph, and his most interesting adventure
brought him into contact with another deity of the sea.</p>

<p>His bees having perished, Arist&aelig;us resorted for aid to his
mother. She, surrounded by her maidens in the crystalline abode
under her river, overheard his complaints and ordered that he
should be brought into her presence. The stream at her command
opened itself and let him enter, while it stood heaped like
a mountain on either side. Cyrene and her nymphs, having poured
out libations to Neptune, gave the youth to eat and listened to his
complaint, then informed him that an aged prophet named Proteus,
who dwelt in the sea and pastured the sea calves of Neptune,
could explain the cause of the mortality among the bees and how
to remedy it; but that the wizard would have to be chained and
compelled to answer, and that even when chained, he would try to
escape by assuming a series of dreadful forms. "Still, thou hast
but to keep him fast bound," concluded Cyrene, "and at last,
when he finds his arts of no avail, he will obey thy behest." The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>nymph then sprinkled her son with nectar, whereupon an unusual
vigor filled his frame and courage his heart.</p>

<p>Cyrene led her son to the prophet's cave, which was in the
island of Pharos, or of Carpathos,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and concealed him. At noon
issued Proteus from the water, followed by his herd of sea calves,
which spread themselves along the shore. He, too, stretched himself
on the floor of the cave and went to sleep. Arist&aelig;us immediately
clapped fetters on him and shouted at the top of his voice.
Proteus, finding himself captured, resorted to his craft, becoming
first a fire, then a flood, then a horrible wild beast, in rapid succession;
nor did he succumb till all schemes had failed to set him
free. Then he resumed his old form and, in response to the
questioning of Arist&aelig;us, said: "Thou receivest the merited reward
of thy deed, by which Eurydice met her death. To avenge her,
the nymphs have sent this destruction on thy bees. Their anger
thou must appease. Four bulls shalt thou select, of perfect form
and size, and four cows of equal beauty; and four altars shalt thou
build to the nymphs, and shalt sacrifice the animals, leaving their
carcasses in the leafy grove. To Orpheus and Eurydice thou shalt
pay such funeral honors as may allay their resentment. Returning
after nine days, examine the bodies of the cattle slain and see
what has befallen." Arist&aelig;us faithfully obeyed these directions.
Returning to the grove on the ninth day he found that a swarm
of bees had taken possession of one of the carcasses and were pursuing
their labors there as in a hive.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p><b>146. Achelo&uuml;s and Hercules.</b><a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> A similar contest took place
between Hercules and the river-god Achelo&uuml;s. The cause of the
strife was Dejanira of Calydon, whom both heroes loved. Hercules
boasted his divine descent. Achelo&uuml;s, not content with advancing
his claim as lord of the mightiest and most ancient river of
Greece, insinuated suspicions with regard to the value of Hercules'
pretensions. Then began a mighty struggle. Finding he was no
match for Hercules in the wrestler's art, Achelo&uuml;s glided away
in the form of a serpent. Hercules, remarking that it was the
labor of his infancy to strangle snakes,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> clasped the neck of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>Achelo&uuml;s and choked him. Then
Achelo&uuml;s assumed the seeming of
a bull. Whereupon Hercules, seizing
him by the horns, dragged his
head to the ground, overthrew him,
and rent one horn away. This
trophy the Naiads consecrated and
filled with flowers for the goddess
of Plenty, who, adopting it as her
symbol, named it Cornucopia.</p>

more graceful poetic use of the divinities
of the streams than has Milton.
The following song, chanted by a
Spirit in invocation of "the gentle

<span class="ph4">MYTHS OF THE OLDER HEROES: THE HOUSE
OF DANA&Uuml;S, AND ITS CONNECTIONS</span></h3>


<p><b>148. The Older and the Younger Heroes.</b> We have already
narrated the adventures of certain demigods and heroes, such
as Prometheus, Deucalion, Cadmus, Amphion, Orpheus. Others
of importance were Perseus, Hercules, Minos, &OElig;dipus, Theseus,
Jason, Meleager, Peleus, Pelops, Castor and Pollux. These and
their contemporaries may be called the <i>Older Heroes</i>. They are
renowned either for individual exploits or for the part played by
them in one or more of three great expeditions,&mdash;the War against
Laomedon of Troy, the Voyage for the Golden Fleece, and the
Hunt of the Calydonian Boar.</p>

<p>The <i>Younger Heroes</i> were of a later generation, which was
concerned in four important enterprises,&mdash;the War of the Seven
against Thebes, the Trojan War, the Wanderings of Ulysses, and
the Adventures of &AElig;neas.</p>

<p>The exploits of the Older Heroes may be arranged in respect of
their probable sequence in time, and of their grouping according
to families of heroes. If we observe the principle of genealogy,
one race, that of Inachus of Argos, attracts our notice in the heroes
descended from Pelasgus,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Belus, and Agenor. The family of Belus
gives us the famous House of Dana&uuml;s, the family of Agenor the
Houses of Minos and Labdacus. Another race, that of Deucalion,
gives us the heroes of the Hellenic branch, most notably those
descended from &AElig;olus. With these families most of the Older
Heroes are, by blood or by adventure, to some extent connected.
Bearing this fact in mind and at the same time observing the
chronological sequence of adventures, we obtain an arrangement of
myths as illustrating the races, families, or houses&mdash;(1) of Dana&uuml;s
of Argos, (2) of &AElig;olus of Thessaly, (3) of &AElig;tolus, (4) of Minos
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>of Crete, (5) of Cecrops and of Erichthonius of Attica, (6) of
Labdacus of Thebes.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p><b>149. The Genealogy of Dana&uuml;s.</b> As the Hellenes, in the north,
traced their descent from Deucalion and Pyrrha of Thessaly, so the
Pelasgic races of the south from the river-god Inachus, son of
Oceanus. The son of Inachus, Phoroneus, lived in the Peloponnesus
and founded the town of Argos. This Phoroneus conferred
upon the Argives the benefits attributed by other Greeks to Prometheus.
He was succeeded by his son Pelasgus, from whom
a division of the Greek people derive their name. With the
love of Jupiter for the sister of Phoroneus, the fair Io, we are
already acquainted. Her son was Epaphus, king of Egypt, from
whom were descended
(1) Agenor of Ph&oelig;nicia,
father of Europa
and Cadmus, and (2)
Belus of Egypt, father
of &AElig;gyptus and Dana&uuml;s.
To the family
of Agenor we shall return
in the history of
Minos, son of Europa,
and of &OElig;dipus, descendant
of Cadmus.</p>

and his fifty daughters back to Argos, the ancestral home of the
race. Finally, a reconciliation was arranged by means of a fiftyfold
marriage between the sons of &AElig;gyptus and the Dana&iuml;ds. But in
accordance with a treacherous command of Dana&uuml;s, all his daughters
save Hypermnestra slew their husbands on the wedding night.
For this crime the forty-nine Dana&iuml;ds were condemned to spend
eternity in Tartarus, trying to fill with water a vessel full of holes.
From Hypermnestra and her husband, Lynceus, was sprung the
royal house of Argos. Their son was Abas, their grandson, Acrisius,&mdash;of
whom the following narrative is told.</p>

was Dana&euml;, of surpassing loveliness. In consequence of an oracle
which had prophesied that the son of Dana&euml; would be the means
of his grandfather's death, the hapless girl was shut in an underground
chamber, that no man might love or wed her. But Jupiter,
distilling himself into a shower of gold, flooded the girl's prison,
wooed, and won her. Their son was Perseus. King Acrisius, in
dismay, ordered mother and child to be boxed up in a chest and
set adrift on the sea. The two unfortunates were, however, rescued
at Seriphus by a fisherman, who conveyed the mother and infant
to Polydectes, king of the country, by whom they were treated at
first with kindness, but afterwards with cruelty.</p>

<p><b>152. Perseus and Medusa.</b><a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> When Perseus was grown up, Polydectes
sent him to attempt the conquest of the Gorgon Medusa,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
a terrible monster who had laid waste the country. She had once
been a maiden whose hair was her chief glory, but as she dared to vie
in beauty with Minerva, the goddess deprived her of her charms and
changed her ringlets into hissing serpents. She became a monster
of so frightful an aspect that no living thing could behold her
without being turned into stone. All around the cavern where she
dwelt might be seen the stony figures of men and animals that had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>chanced to catch a glimpse of her and had been petrified at the
sight. Perseus, favored by Minerva and Mercury, set out against
the Gorgon, and approached first the cave of the three Gr&aelig;&aelig;:</p>

<p>Snatching the eye, Perseus compelled the Gr&aelig;&aelig;, as the price
of its restoration, to tell him how he might obtain the helmet of
Hades that renders its wearer invisible,
and the winged shoes and pouch that
were necessary. With this outfit, to
which Minerva added her shield and
Mercury his knife, Perseus sped to the
hall of the Gorgons. In silence sat two

<p>This was Medusa. Her, while she was praying the gods to end
her misery, or, as some say, while she was sleeping, Perseus approached,
and, guided by her
image reflected in the bright
shield which he bore, cut off
her head, and so ended her
miserable existence. Thus are
described the horror and the
grace of her features in death:</p>

<p><b>153. Perseus and Atlas.</b> From the body of Medusa sprang
the winged horse Pegasus, of whose rider, Bellerophon, we shall
presently be informed.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 120. Perseus with Head of Medusa</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>After the slaughter of Medusa, Perseus, bearing with him the head
of the Gorgon, flew far and wide, over land and sea. As night came
on, he reached the western limit of the earth, and would gladly have
rested till morning. Here was the realm of Atlas, whose bulk surpassed
that of all other men. He was rich in flocks and herds, but
his chief pride was his garden of the Hesperides, whose fruit was
of gold, hanging from golden branches,
half hid with golden leaves. Perseus said
to him, "I come as a guest. If thou holdest
in honor illustrious descent, I claim
Jupiter for my father; if mighty deeds, I
plead the conquest of the Gorgon. I seek
rest and food." But Atlas, remembering
an ancient prophecy that had warned him
against a son of Jove who should one day
rob him of his golden apples, attempted
to thrust the youth out. Whereupon Perseus,
finding the giant too strong for him,
held up the Gorgon's head. Atlas, with
all his bulk, was changed into stone. His
beard and hair became forests, his arms
and shoulders cliffs, his head a summit, and
his bones rocks. Each part increased in mass till the giant became
the mountain upon whose shoulders rests heaven with all its stars.</p>

<p><b>154. Perseus and Andromeda.</b> On his way back to Seriphus, the
Gorgon-slayer arrived at the country of the &AElig;thiopians, over whom
Cepheus was king. His wife was Cassiopea&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That starred &AElig;thiope queen that strove<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>These nymphs had consequently sent a sea monster to ravage
the coast. To appease the deities, Cepheus was directed by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>oracle to devote his daughter Andromeda to the ravening maw
of the prodigy. As Perseus looked down from his a&euml;rial height,
he beheld the virgin chained to a rock. Drawing nearer he pitied,
then comforted her, and sought the reason of her disgrace. At
first from modesty she was silent; but when he repeated his questions,
for fear she might be thought guilty of some offense which
she dared not tell, she disclosed her name and that of her country,
and her mother's pride of beauty. Before she had done speaking, a
sound was heard upon the water, and the monster appeared. The virgin
shrieked; the father and mother, who had now arrived, poured
forth lamentations and threw their arms about the victim. But the
hero himself undertook to slay the monster, on condition that, if the
maiden were rescued by his valor, she should be his reward. The
parents consented. Perseus embraced his promised bride; then&mdash;</p>

<p>The youth darted down upon the back of the monster and
plunged his sword into its shoulder, then eluded its furious attack
by means of his wings. Wherever he could find a passage for his
sword, he plunged it between the scales of flank and side. The
wings of the hero were finally drenched and unmanageable with the
blood and water that the brute spouted. Then alighting on a rock
and holding by a projection, he gave the monster his deathblow.</p>

<p>The joyful parents, with Perseus and Andromeda, repaired to
the palace, where a banquet was opened for them. But in the
midst of the festivities a noise was heard of warlike clamor, and
Phineus, who had formerly been betrothed to the bride, burst in,
demanding her for his own. In vain, Cepheus remonstrated that
all such engagements had been dissolved by the sentence of death
passed upon Andromeda, and that if Phineus had actually loved
the girl, he would have tried to rescue her. Phineus and his adherents,
persisting in their intent, attacked the wedding party and
would have broken it up with most admired disorder, but</p>

<p>Leaving Phineus and his fellows in merited petrifaction, and conveying
Andromeda to Seriphus, the hero there turned into stone
Polydectes and his court, because the tyrant had rendered Dana&euml;'s life
intolerable with his attentions. Perseus then restored to their owners
the charmed helmet, the winged shoes, and the pouch in which he
had conveyed the Gorgon's head. The head itself he bestowed upon
Minerva, who bore it afterward upon her &aelig;gis or shield. Of that
Gorgon shield no simpler moral interpretation can be framed than
the following:</p>

<p>With his mother and his wife Perseus returned to Argos to seek
his grandfather. But Acrisius, still fearing his doom, had retired
to Larissa in Thessaly. Thither Perseus followed him, and found
him presiding over certain funeral games. As luck would have it,
the hero took part in the quoit throwing, and hurled a quoit far
beyond the mark. The disk, falling upon his grandfather's foot,
brought about the old man's death, and in that way the prophecy
was fulfilled. Of Perseus and Andromeda three sons were born,
through one of whom, Electryon, they became grandparents of the
famous Alcmene, sweetheart of Jove and mother of Hercules.</p>

<p><b>155. Bellerophon and the Chim&aelig;ra.</b><a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> The horse Pegasus, which
sprang from the Gorgon's blood, found a master in Bellerophon of
Corinth. This youth was of the Hellenic branch of the Greek
nation, being descended from Sisyphus and through him from
&AElig;olus, the son of Hellen.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> His adventures should therefore be
recited with those of Jason and other descendants of &AElig;olus in the
next chapter, but that they follow so closely on those of Perseus.
His father, Glaucus, king of Corinth, is frequently identified with
Glaucus the fisherman. This Glaucus of Corinth was noted for his
love of horse racing, his fashion of feeding his mares on human
flesh, and his destruction by the fury of his horses; for having
upset his chariot, they tore their master to pieces. As to his son,
Bellerophon, the following is related:</p>

<p>In Lycia a monster, breathing fire, made great havoc. The
fore part of his body was a compound of the lion and the goat;
the hind part was a dragon's. The king, Iobates, sought a hero to
destroy this Chim&aelig;ra, as it was called. At that time Bellerophon
arrived at his court. The gallant youth brought letters from
Pr&oelig;tus, the son-in-law of Iobates, recommending Bellerophon in
the warmest terms as an unconquerable hero, but adding a request
to his father-in-law to put him to death. For Pr&oelig;tus, suspecting
that his wife Antea looked with too great favor on the young
warrior, schemed thus to destroy him.</p>

<p>Iobates accordingly determined to send Bellerophon against
the Chim&aelig;ra. Bellerophon accepted the proposal, but before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>proceeding to the combat, consulted the soothsayer Polyidus, who
counseled him to procure, if possible, the horse Pegasus for the
conflict. Now this horse had been caught and tamed by Minerva
and by her presented to the Muses. Polyidus, therefore, directed
Bellerophon to pass the night in the temple of Minerva. While he
slept, Minerva brought him a golden bridle. When he awoke, she
showed him Pegasus drinking at the well of Pirene. At sight of the
bridle, the winged steed came
willingly and suffered himself
to be taken. Bellerophon
mounted him, sped through
the air, found the Chim&aelig;ra,
and gained an easy victory.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 122. Bellerophon and Pegasus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>After the conquest of this
monster, Bellerophon was subjected
to further trials and
labors by his unfriendly host,
but by the aid of Pegasus he
triumphed over all. At length
Iobates, seeing that the hero
was beloved of the gods, gave
him his daughter in marriage
and made him his successor
on the throne. It is said that
Bellerophon, by his pride and
presumption, drew upon himself
the anger of the Olympians;
that he even attempted to fly
to heaven on his winged steed;
but the king of gods and men sent a gadfly, which, stinging Pegasus,
caused him to throw his rider, who wandered ever after lame, blind,
and lonely through the Aleian field, and perished miserably.</p>

<p><b>156. Hercules (Heracles): His Youth.</b><a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Alcmene, daughter of
Electryon and granddaughter of Perseus and Andromeda, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>beloved of Jupiter. Their son, the mighty Hercules, born in
Thebes, became the national hero of Greece. Juno, always hostile
to the offspring of her husband by mortal mothers, declared war
against Hercules from his birth. She sent two serpents to destroy
him as he lay in his cradle, but the precocious infant strangled
them with his hands. In his youth he passed for the son of his stepfather
Amphitryon, king of Thebes, grandson of Perseus and
Andromeda, and son of Alc&aelig;us. Hence his patronymic, Alcides.
Rhadamanthus trained him in wisdom and virtue, Linus in music.
Unfortunately the latter attempted one day to chastise Hercules;
whereupon the pupil killed the master with a lute. After this melancholy
breach of discipline, the youth was rusticated,&mdash;sent off to
the mountains, where among the herdsmen and the cattle he grew
to mighty stature, slew the Thespian lion, and performed various
deeds of valor. To him, while still a youth, appeared, according to
one story, two women at a meeting of the ways,&mdash;Pleasure and
Duty. The gifts offered by Duty were the "Choice of Hercules."
Soon afterward he contended with none other than Apollo for the
tripod of Delphi; but reconciliation was effected between the combatants
by the gods of Olympus, and from that day forth Apollo
and Hercules remained true friends, each respecting the prowess
of the other. Returning to Thebes, the hero aided his half brother
Iphicles and his reputed father Amphitryon in throwing off the
yoke of the city of Orchomenus, and was rewarded with the hand
of the princess Megara. A few years later, while in the very pride
of his manhood, he was driven insane by the implacable Juno. In
his madness he slew his children, and would have slain Amphitryon,
also, had not Minerva knocked him over with a stone and
plunged him into a deep sleep, from which he awoke in his right
mind. Next, for expiation of the bloodshed, he was rendered subject
to his cousin Eurystheus and compelled to perform his commands.
This humiliation, Juno, of course, had decreed.</p>

<p><b>157. His Labors.</b> Eurystheus enjoined upon the hero a succession
of desperate undertakings, which are called the twelve "Labors
of Hercules." The first was the combat with the lion that infested
the valley of Nemea, the skin of which Hercules was ordered
to bring to Mycen&aelig;. After using in vain his club and arrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
against the lion, Hercules strangled the animal with his hands
and returned, carrying its carcass on his shoulders; but Eurystheus,
frightened at the sight and at this proof of the prodigious
strength of the hero, ordered him to deliver the account of his
exploits, in future, outside
the town.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 123. Heracles and the Nemean Lion</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>His second labor
was the slaughter of
the Hydra, a water
serpent that ravaged
the country of Argos
and dwelt in a swamp
near the well of Amymone.
It had nine
heads, of which the
middle one was immortal.
Hercules struck
off the heads with his club; but in the place of each dispatched,
two new ones appeared. At last, with the assistance of his faithful
nephew Iola&uuml;s, he burned away the other heads of the Hydra and
buried the ninth, which was immortal, under a rock.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image134.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 124. Heracles and the Hydra</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>His third labor was the capture of a boar that haunted Mount
Erymanthus in Arcadia. The adventure was, in itself, successful.
But on the same journey
Hercules made the
friendship of the centaur
Pholus, who, receiving
him hospitably,
poured out for him
without stint the choicest
wine that the centaurs
possessed. As a
consequence, Hercules
became involved in a
broil with the other centaurs of the mountain. Unfortunately his
friend Pholus, drawing one of the arrows of Hercules from a brother
centaur, wounded himself therewith and died of the poison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>The fourth labor of Hercules was the capture of a wonderful
stag of golden antlers and brazen hoofs, that ranged the hills of
Cerynea, between Arcadia and Achaia.</p>

<p>His fifth labor was the destruction of the Stymphalian birds,
which with cruel beaks and sharp talons harassed the inhabitants
of the valley of Stymphalus, devouring many of them.</p>

<p>His sixth labor was the cleaning of the Augean stables. Augeas,
king of Elis, had a herd of three thousand oxen, whose stalls had not
been cleansed for thirty years. Hercules, bringing the rivers Alphe&uuml;s
and Pene&uuml;s through them, purified them thoroughly in one day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image135.jpg" width="400" height="216" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 125. Heracles bringing Home the Boar</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>His seventh labor was the overthrow of the Cretan bull,&mdash;an awful
but beautiful brute, at once a gift and a curse bestowed by Neptune
upon Minos of Crete.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> This monster Hercules brought to Mycen&aelig;.</p>

<p>His eighth labor was the removal of the horses of Diomedes,
king of Thrace. These horses subsisted on human flesh, were
swift and fearful. Diomedes, attempting to retain them, was killed
by Hercules and given to the horses to devour. They were then
delivered to Eurystheus; but, escaping, they roamed the hills of
Arcadia, till the wild beasts of Apollo tore them to pieces.</p>

<p>His ninth labor was of a more delicate character. Admeta, the
daughter of Eurystheus, desired the girdle of the queen of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>Amazons, and Eurystheus ordered Hercules to get it. The Amazons
were a nation dominated by warlike women, and in their
hands were many cities. It was their custom to bring up only the
female children, whom they hardened by martial discipline; the
boys were either dispatched to the neighboring nations or put to
death. Hippolyta, the queen, received Hercules kindly and consented
to yield him the girdle; but Juno, taking the form of an
Amazon, persuaded the people that the strangers were carrying off
their queen. They instantly
armed and beset the ship.
Whereupon Hercules, thinking
that Hippolyta had acted
treacherously, slew her and,
taking her girdle, made sail
homeward.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 285px;">
<img src="images/image136.jpg" width="285" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 126. Heracles with the Bull</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The tenth task enjoined
upon him was to capture
for Eurystheus the oxen
of Geryon, a monster with
three bodies, who dwelt in
the island Erythea (the
red),&mdash;so called because
it lay in the west, under
the rays of the setting sun.
This description is thought
to apply to Spain, of which Geryon was king. After traversing
various countries, Hercules reached at length the frontiers of
Libya and Europe, where he raised the two mountains of Abyla
and Calpe as monuments of his progress,&mdash;the Pillars of Hercules;
or, according to another account, rent one mountain into
two and left half on each side, forming the Strait of Gibraltar.
The oxen were guarded by the giant Eurytion and his two-headed
dog, but Hercules killed the warders and conveyed the oxen in
safety to Eurystheus.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult labors was the eleventh,&mdash;the robbery
of the golden apples of the Hesperides. Hercules did not know
where to find them; but after various adventures, arrived at Mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Atlas in Africa. Since Atlas was the father of the Hesperides,
Hercules thought he might through him obtain the apples. The
hero, accordingly, taking the burden of the heavens on his own
shoulders,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> sent Atlas to seek the apples. The giant returned with
them and proposed to take them himself to Eurystheus. "Even
so," said Hercules; "but, pray, hold this load for me a moment,
while I procure a pad to ease my shoulders." Unsuspectingly the
giant resumed the burden of the heavens. Hercules took the
apples.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/image137.jpg" width="300" height="186" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 127 Heracles and Cerberus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>His twelfth exploit was to fetch Cerberus from the lower world.
To this end he descended into Hades, accompanied by Mercury
and Minerva. There
he obtained permission
from Pluto to carry
Cerberus to the upper
air, provided he could
do it without the use
of weapons. In spite
of the monster's struggling
he seized him,
held him fast, carried
him to Eurystheus, and
afterward restored him
to the lower regions. While in Hades, Hercules also obtained
the liberty of Theseus, his admirer and imitator, who had been
detained there for an attempt at abducting Proserpine.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>After his return from Hades to his native Thebes, he renounced
his wife Megara, for, having slain his children by her in
his fit of madness, he looked upon the marriage as displeasing to
the gods.</p>

<p>Two other exploits not recorded among the twelve labors are
the victories over Ant&aelig;us and Cacus. Ant&aelig;us, the son of Poseidon
and G&aelig;a, was a giant and wrestler whose strength was invincible
so long as he remained in contact with his mother Earth. He
compelled all strangers who came to his country to wrestle with
him, on condition that if conquered, they should suffer death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>Hercules encountered him and, finding that it was of no avail
to throw him,&mdash;for he always rose with renewed strength from
every fall,&mdash;lifted him up from the earth and strangled him in
the air.</p>

<p>Later writers tell of an army of Pygmies which, finding Hercules
asleep after his defeat of Ant&aelig;us, made preparations to
attack him, as if they were about to attack a city. But the hero,
awakening, laughed at the little warriors, wrapped some of them
up in his lion's skin, and carried them to Eurystheus.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image138.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 128. Heracles and Ant&aelig;us</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Cacus was a giant who inhabited a cave on Mount Aventine
and plundered the surrounding country. When Hercules was driving
home the oxen of Geryon, Cacus stole part of the cattle while
the hero slept. That their footprints might not indicate where
they had been driven,
he dragged them backward
by their tails to
his cave. Hercules
was deceived by the
stratagem and would
have failed to find his
oxen, had it not happened
that while he was
driving the remainder
of the herd past the
cave where the stolen ones were concealed, those within, beginning to
low, discovered themselves to him. Hercules promptly dispatched
the thief.</p>

<p>Through most of these expeditions Hercules was attended by
Iola&uuml;s, his devoted friend, the son of his half brother Iphicles.</p>

<p><b>158. His Later Exploits.</b> On the later exploits of the hero we
can dwell but briefly. Having, in a fit of madness, killed his friend
Iphitus, he was condemned for the offense to spend three years as
the slave of Queen Omphale. He lived effeminately, wearing at
times the dress of a woman and spinning wool with the handmaidens
of Omphale, while the queen wore his lion's skin. But
during this period he contrived to engage in about as many adventures
as would fill the life of an ordinary hero. He rescued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Daphnis from Lityerses and threw the bloodthirsty king<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> into the
river M&aelig;ander; he discovered the body of Icarus<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and buried it;
he joined the company of Argonauts, who were on their way to
Colchis to secure the golden fleece, and he captured the thievish
gnomes, called Cercopes. Two of these grotesque rascals had
made off with the weapons of Hercules while he was sleeping.
When he had caught them he strapped them, knees upward, to a
yoke and so bore them away. Their drollery, however, regained
them their liberty. It is said that some of them having once
deceived Jupiter were changed to apes.</p>

<p><b>159. The Loss of Hylas.</b><a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> In the Argonautic adventure Hercules
was attended by a lad, Hylas, whom he tenderly loved and
on whose account he deserted the expedition in Mysia; for Hylas
had been stolen by the Naiads.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>... Never was Heracles apart from Hylas, not when midnoon was high in
heaven, not when Dawn with her white horses speeds upwards to the dwelling
of Zeus, not when the twittering nestlings look towards the perch, while their
mother flaps her wings above the smoke-browned beam; and all this that the
lad might be fashioned to his mind, and might drive a straight furrow, and
come to the true measure of man....</p>

<p>And Hylas of the yellow hair, with a vessel of bronze in his hand, went to
draw water against supper-time for Heracles himself and the steadfast Telamon,
for these comrades twain supped ever at one table. Soon was he ware of a
spring in a hollow land, and the rushes grew thickly round it, and dark swallowwort,
and green maidenhair, and blooming parsley, and deer grass spreading
through the marshy land. In the midst of the water the nymphs were arranging
their dances,&mdash;the sleepless nymphs, dread goddesses of the country people,
Eunice, and Malis, and Nycheia, with her April eyes. And now the boy was
holding out the wide-mouthed pitcher to the water, intent on dipping it; but the
nymphs all clung to his hand, for love of the Argive lad had fluttered the soft
hearts of all of them. Then down he sank into the black water, headlong all,
as when a star shoots flaming from the sky, plumb in the deep it falls; and a
mate shouts out to the seamen, "Up with the gear, my lads, the wind is fair
for sailing."</p>

<p>Then the nymphs held the weeping boy on their laps, and with gentle words
were striving to comfort him. But the son of Amphitryon was troubled about the
lad, and went forth, carrying his bended bow in Scythian fashion, and the club
that is ever grasped in his right hand. Thrice he shouted, "Hylas!" as loud as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>his deep throat could call, and thrice again the boy heard him, and thrice came
his voice from the water, and, hard by though he was, he seemed very far away.
And as when a bearded lion, a ravening lion on the hills, hears the bleating of
a fawn afar off and rushes forth from his lair to seize it, his readiest meal, even
so the mighty Heracles, in longing for the lad, sped through the trackless briars
and ranged over much country.</p>

<p>Reckless are lovers: great toils did Heracles bear, in hills and thickets
wandering; and Jason's quest was all postponed to this....</p>

<p>Thus loveliest Hylas is numbered with the Blessed; but for a runaway they
girded at Heracles&mdash;the heroes&mdash;because he roamed from Argo of the sixty
oarsmen. But on foot he came to Colchis and inhospitable Phasis.</p></div>

<p><b>160. The Rescue of Daphnis.</b><a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Daphnis was the ideal Sicilian
shepherd and to him was ascribed the invention of pastoral story
and song. His father was Hermes (Mercury); his mother, a
nymph who laid him when an infant in a charming valley in a
laurel grove from which he received his name,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> and on account of
which Apollo loved him and endowed him with the gift of idyllic
verse. He was brought up by nymphs and shepherds, and, avoiding
the noisy haunts of men, he tended his flocks on Mount &AElig;tna,
winter and summer. He loved a maiden named Piplea, but she
was borne away by robbers. He followed them to Phrygia, and
there found his sweetheart in the power of the king of that realm,
Lityerses. This Lityerses had a pleasant custom of making strangers
try a contest with him in reaping corn. If he overcame them,
he cut off their heads in the evening and concealed their bodies in
the sheaves, singing a comfortable song meanwhile. In order to
win back Piplea, Daphnis entered upon the reaping contest with
the king and made himself comfortable, too, by singing a harvest
song meanwhile. But Lityerses surpassed him at the work and
was about to put him to death, singing no doubt a comfortable
song of the reaper, Death, meanwhile,&mdash;when suddenly Hercules
appeared upon the scene. He doesn't seem to have spent much
time singing: he assured Daphnis of his head by cutting off that
of the pleasant king; and then he threw the body into the river
M&aelig;ander. Daphnis regained his Piplea and one would suppose
that they lived happy ever after. Another story, unfortunately,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>relates events in which Piplea's name does not occur. A Naiad
fell in love with the handsome shepherd and made him promise
eternal fidelity to her, threatening him with blindness if he violated
his vow. It was hard for poor Daphnis, for nearly every lass he
met made love to him. At last a princess intoxicated him and
he forgot his vow. Immediately the Naiad showed the quality of
her love by striking him blind. He consoled himself for a while
by singing his songs and playing the flute as he wandered from
place to place. Then weary, he called on his father for aid. Mercury
accordingly transported him to heaven and caused a well to
gush forth on the spot from which he ascended. Here the Sicilians
offered yearly sacrifice in his honor.</p>

<p>Theocritus gives us a Lityerses song as he undoubtedly used to
hear it sung by the harvesters of the country-side in Sicily:<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p><b>161. The Expedition against Laomedon.</b> After his servitude
under Omphale was ended, Hercules sailed with eighteen ships
against Troy. For Laomedon, king of that realm, had refused to
give Hercules the horses of Neptune, which he had promised in
gratitude for the rescue of his daughter Hesione from the sea-monster.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
The hero, overcoming Troy, placed a son of Laomedon,
Priam, upon the throne, and gave Hesione to Telamon, who, with
Peleus, O&iuml;cles, and other Greek heroes, had accompanied him.
Also worthy of mention among the exploits of Hercules were his
successful expeditions against Pylos and Sparta, his victory over
the giants, his struggle with Death for the body and life of
Alcestis,<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> and his delivery, according to prophecy, of Prometheus,
who until that time had remained in chains upon the Caucasian
Mountains.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p><b>162. The Death of Hercules.</b> Finally, the hero married Dejanira,
daughter of &OElig;neus of Calydon and sister of Meleager of the
Calydonian hunt. With her he lived three prosperous years. But
on one occasion, as they journeyed together, they came to a river
across which the centaur Nessus carried travelers for a stated fee.
Hercules proceeded to ford the river and gave Dejanira to Nessus
to be carried across. Nessus, however, attempted to make off with
her; whereupon Hercules, hearing her cries, shot an arrow into his
heart. The centaur, as he died, bade Dejanira take a portion of his
blood and keep it, saying that it might be used as a charm to preserve
the love of her husband. Dejanira did so. Before long,
jealous of Hercules' fondness for Iole of &OElig;chalia, a captive maiden,
she steeped a sacrificial robe of her husband's in the blood of
Nessus. As soon as the garment became warm on the body of
Hercules, the poison penetrated his limbs. In his frenzy he seized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>Lichas, who had brought him the fatal robe, and hurled him into
the sea; then tried to wrench off the garment, but it stuck to his
flesh and tore away whole pieces of his body.</p>

<p>In this state he embarked on board a ship and was conveyed home.
Dejanira, on seeing what she had unwittingly done, hanged herself.
Hercules, prepared to die, ascended Mount &OElig;ta, where he built a
funeral pile of trees, gave his bow and arrows to Philoctetes,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and
laid himself upon the pile, his head resting on his club and his
lion's skin spread over him. With a countenance as serene as if
he were taking his place at a festal board, he commanded Philoctetes
to apply the torch. The flames spread apace, and soon invested
the whole mass.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>The gods themselves grieved to see the champion of the earth
so brought to his end. But Jupiter took care that only his mother's
part in him should perish by the flames. The immortal element,
derived from Jupiter himself, was translated to heaven; and by
the consent of the gods&mdash;even of reluctant Juno&mdash;Hercules was
admitted as a deity to the ranks of the immortals. The white-armed
queen of heaven was finally reconciled to the offspring of
Alcmene. She adopted him for her son and gave him in marriage
her daughter Hebe.</p>

<p>In the tragedy called The Maidens of Trachis, Sophocles describes
this hero as "The noblest man of all the earth, of whom
thou ne'er shalt see the like again." To some of us the manner
of his earthly end may seem unworthy; but the Greek poets teach
that, in the unabated vigor of one's powers, serenely to meet and
accept one's doom is the happiest death. This view is well expressed
by Matthew Arnold in the following fragment of a Greek
chorus sung with reference to the death of Hercules:</p>

<span class="ph4">THE FAMILY OF &AElig;OLUS</span></h3>


<p><b>163. Descendants of Deucalion.</b> Athamas, brother of Sisyphus,
was descended from &AElig;olus, whose father, Hellen, was the son of
Deucalion of Thessaly. Athamas had by his wife Nephele two
children, Phrixus and Helle. After a time, growing indifferent to
his wife, Athamas put her away and took Ino, the daughter of
Cadmus. The unfortunate sequel of this second marriage we have
already seen.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Nephele, apprehending danger to her children from the influence
of their stepmother, took measures to put them out of her
reach. Mercury gave her a ram with a golden fleece, on which she
set the two children. Vaulting into the air, the animal took his
course to the east; but when he was crossing the strait that divides
Europe and Asia, the girl Helle fell from his back into the sea,
which from her was afterward called the Hellespont&mdash;now the
Dardanelles. The ram safely landed the boy Phrixus in Colchis,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>where he was hospitably received by &AElig;etes, the king of that country.
Phrixus sacrificed the ram to Jupiter, but the fleece he gave
to &AElig;etes, who placed it in a consecrated grove under the care of
a sleepless dragon.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p><b>164. The Quest of the Golden Fleece.</b><a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> Another realm in Thessaly,
near to that of Athamas, was ruled over by his nephew &AElig;son.
&AElig;son, although he had a son Jason, surrendered the crown to a
half brother, Pelias,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> on condition that he should hold it only during
the minority of the lad. This young Jason was, by the way, a
second cousin of Bellerophon and of the Atalanta who ran against
Hippomenes, and a first cousin of Admetus, the husband of Alcestis.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
When, however, Jason, being grown up, came to demand the crown,
his uncle Pelias with wily intent suggested to him the glorious
quest of the golden fleece. Jason, pleased with the thought, forthwith
made preparations for the expedition. At that time the only
species of navigation known to the Greeks consisted of small boats
or canoes hollowed out from trunks of trees; when, accordingly,
Jason employed Argus to build a vessel capable of containing fifty
men, it was considered a gigantic undertaking. The vessel was
named <i>Argo</i>, probably after its builder. Jason soon found himself
at the head of a bold band of comrades, many of whom afterward
were renowned among the heroes and demigods of Greece.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From every region of &AElig;gea's shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brave assembled; those illustrious twins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Castor and Pollux; Orpheus, tuneful bard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zetes and Cala&iuml;s, as the wind in speed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong Hercules and many a chief renowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On deep Iolcos' sandy shore they thronged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleaming in armor, ardent of exploits,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon, the laurel cord and the huge stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uplifting to the deck, unmoored the bark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose keel of wondrous length the skillful hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Argus fashioned for the proud attempt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the extended keel a lofty mast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upraised, and sails full swelling; to the chiefs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwonted objects. Now first, now they learned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bolder steerage over ocean wave,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Led by the golden stars, as Chiron's art<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Theseus, Meleager, Peleus, and Nestor were also among these
Argonauts, or sailors of the <i>Argo</i>. The ship with her crew of
heroes left the shores of Thessaly, and touching at the island of
Lemnos, thence crossed to Mysia and thence to Thrace. Here
they found the sage Phineus, who instructed the Argonauts how
they might pass the Symplegades, or Clashing Islands, at the
entrance of the Euxine Sea. When they reached these islands
they, accordingly, let go a dove, which took her way between the
rocks and passed in safety, only losing some feathers of her tail.
Jason and his men, seizing the favorable moment of the rebound,
plied their oars with vigor and passed safe through, though the
islands closed behind them and actually grazed the stern of the vessel.
They then rowed along the shore till they arrived at the eastern
end of the sea, and so landed in the kingdom of Colchis.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/image142.jpg" width="400" height="155" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 131. Jason Conquers the Bulls and Steals the Fleece</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Jason made known his message to the Colchian king, &AElig;etes,
who consented to give up the golden fleece on certain conditions,
namely, that Jason should yoke to the plow two fire-breathing
bulls with brazen feet, and that he then should sow the teeth of
the dragon that Cadmus had slain. Jason, although it was well
known that a crop of armed men would spring up from the teeth,
destined to turn their weapons against their producer, accepted
the conditions, and a time was set for the undertaking. The hero,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>however, wisely spent the interval in wooing Medea, the daughter
of &AElig;etes; and with such success that they plighted troth before
the altar of Hecate. The princess then furnished her hero with a
charm which should aid him in the contest to come.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the momentous day was arrived, Jason with
calmness encountered the fire-breathing monsters and speedily
yoked them to the plow. The Colchians stood in amazement;
the Greeks shouted for joy. Next, the hero proceeded to sow the
dragon's teeth and plow them in. Up sprang, according to prediction,
the crop of armed men, brandished aloft their weapons,
and rushed upon Jason. The Greeks trembled for their hero.
Medea herself grew pale with fear. The hero himself for a time,
with sword and shield, kept his assailants at bay; but he surely
would have been overwhelmed by the numbers, had he not resorted
to a charm which Medea had taught him: seizing a stone, he threw
it in the midst of his foes. Immediately they turned their arms
against one another, and soon there was not one of the dragon's
brood alive.</p>

<p>It remained only to lull to sleep the dragon that guarded the
fleece. This was done by scattering over him a few drops of a
preparation which, again, Medea had supplied. Jason then seized
the fleece, and, with his friends and his sweetheart accompanying,
hastened to the vessel. It is said that, in order to delay the pursuit
of her father &AElig;etes, Medea tore to pieces her young brother
Absyrtus and strewed fragments of him along the line of their
flight. The ruse succeeded.</p>

<p><b>165. The Return of the Argonauts.</b> On their way home the
Argonauts beat a devious course, sailing after other dangers had
been overcome, by the island that the Sirens infested. And here
the heroes would have hung their halsers and remained, had not
Orpheus vanquished the seductive strains of the sea-muses with his
own more melodious and persuasive song.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, happy seafarers are ye<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And surely all your ills are past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And toil upon the land and sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since ye are brought to us at last;<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>
<p>chanted the Sirens, promising long rest and the kingdoms of sleep.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now, but now, when ye have lain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Asleep with us a little while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the washing of the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How calm shall be your waking smile!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then Orpheus replied, encouraging his men:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A little more, a little more,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O carriers of the Golden Fleece!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little labor with the oar,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Men's ears of this our victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And draw them down upon the beach<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To gaze across the empty sea.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Again the Sirens:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alas! and will ye stop your ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In vain desire to do aught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wish to live 'mid cares and fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Until the last fear makes you nought?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Orpheus, reminding the rowers of home and love and joy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Is not the May-time now on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When close against the city wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The folks are singing in their mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While on their heads the May flowers fall?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>carried them past triumphant.</p>

<p>The Argonauts arrived safe in Thessaly. Jason delivered the
fleece to Pelias, and dedicated the <i>Argo</i> to Neptune.</p>

<p><b>166. Medea and &AElig;son.</b><a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Medea's career as a sorceress was, by
no means, completed. At Jason's request she undertook next to
restore his aged father &AElig;son to the vigor of youth. To the full
moon she addressed her incantations, to the stars, to Hecate, to
Tellus, the goddess of the earth. In a chariot borne aloft by
dragons she traversed the fields of air to regions where flourished
potent plants, which only she knew how to select. Nine nights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>she employed in her search, and during that period shunned all
intercourse with mortals.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 133px;">
<img src="images/image143.jpg" width="133" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 132. Medea</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Next she erected two altars, the one to Hecate, the other to
Hebe, and sacrificed a black sheep,&mdash;pouring libations of milk
and wine. She implored Pluto and his stolen bride to spare the
old man's life. Then she directed that &AElig;son be led forth; and
throwing him into a deep sleep, she laid him
on a bed of herbs, like one dead. No eye profane
looked upon her mysteries. With streaming
hair thrice she moved round the altars,
dipped flaming twigs in the blood, and laid
them thereon to burn. Meanwhile, the caldron
with its contents was preparing. In it she put
magic herbs, with seeds and flowers of acrid
juice, stones from the distant East, and sand
from the shore of all-surrounding ocean, hoar-frost
gathered by moonlight, a screech owl's
head and wings, and the entrails of a wolf.
She added fragments of the shells of tortoises
and the liver of stags&mdash;animals tenacious of
life&mdash;and the head and beak of a crow, which
outlives nine generations of men. These, with
many other things "without a name," she
boiled together for her purposed work, stirring
them with a dry olive branch. The branch,
when taken out, instantly was green and erelong
was covered with leaves and a plentiful
growth of young olives; and as the liquor
boiled and bubbled and sometimes bubbled over, the grass wherever
the sprinklings fell leaped into verdure like that of spring.</p>

<p>Seeing that all was ready, Medea cut the throat of the old man,
let out his blood, and poured into his mouth and his wound the
juices of her caldron. As soon as he had completely imbibed them,
his hair and beard lost their whiteness and assumed the color of
youth; his paleness and emaciation were gone; his veins were
full of blood, his limbs of vigor and robustness; and &AElig;son, on
awakening, found himself forty years younger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 253px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 133. Medea and Daughters of Pelias</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><b>167. Pelias.</b><a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> In another instance, Medea made her arts the
instrument of revenge. Pelias, the usurping uncle of Jason, still
kept him out of his heritage. But the daughters of Pelias wished
Medea to restore their father also to youth. Medea simulated
consent, but prepared her caldron for him in a new and singular
way. She put in only water and a few simple herbs.
In the night she persuaded the daughters of Pelias to kill him.
They at first hesitated to strike, but Medea chiding their irresolution,
they turned away
their faces and, giving
random blows, smote him
with their weapons. Starting
from his sleep, the
old man cried out, "My
daughters, would you kill
your father?" Whereat
their hearts failed them,
and the weapons fell from
their hands. Medea, however,
struck the fatal blow.</p>

<p>They placed him in the
caldron, but, as might be
expected, with no success.
Medea herself had taken
care to escape before they
discovered the treachery.
She had, however, little
profit of the fruits of her crime. Jason, for whom she had sacrificed
so much, put her away, for he wished to marry Cre&uuml;sa, princess
of Corinth. Whereupon Medea, enraged at his ingratitude,
called on the gods for vengeance; then, sending a poisoned robe
as a gift to the bride, killing her own children, and setting fire
to the palace, she mounted her serpent-drawn chariot and fled to
Athens. There she married King &AElig;geus, the father of Theseus;
and we shall meet her again when we come to the adventures of
that hero.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>The incantation of Medea readily suggests that of the witches
in Macbeth:</p>

<span class="ph4">THE FAMILY OF &AElig;TOLUS AND ITS CONNECTIONS</span></h3>


<p><b>168. The Calydonian Hunt.</b><a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> One of the heroes of the Argonautic
expedition had been Meleager, a son of &OElig;neus and Alth&aelig;a,
rulers of Calydon in &AElig;tolia. His parents were cousins, descended
from a son of Endymion named &AElig;tolus, who had colonized that
realm. By ties of kinship and marriage they were allied with many
historic figures. Their daughter Dejanira had become, as we have
already noted, the wife of Hercules; while Leda, the sister of
Alth&aelig;a, was mother of Castor and Pollux,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and of Clytemnestra
and Helen, intimately concerned in the Trojan War.</p>

<p>When her son Meleager was born, Alth&aelig;a had beheld the three
Destinies, who, as they spun their fatal thread, foretold that the
life of the child should last no longer than a certain brand then
burning upon the hearth. Alth&aelig;a seized and quenched the brand,
and carefully preserved it while Meleager grew to boyhood, youth,
and man's estate. It chanced, then, that &OElig;neus, offering sacrifices
to the gods, omitted to pay due honors to Diana; wherefore she,
indignant at the neglect, sent a boar of enormous size to lay waste
the fields of Calydon. Meleager called on the heroes of Greece
to join in a hunt for the ravenous monster. Theseus and his friend
Piritho&uuml;s,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Jason, Peleus the father of Achilles, Telamon the father
of Ajax, Nestor, then a youth, but who in his age bore arms with
Achilles and Ajax in the Trojan War,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>&mdash;these and many more
joined in the enterprise. With them came, also, Atalanta, the
daughter of Iasius, of the race of Callisto,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Arcadian Atalanta, snowy-souled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair as the snow and footed as the wind.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a><br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>A buckle of polished gold confined her vest, an ivory quiver hung
on her left shoulder, and her left hand bore the bow. Her face
blended feminine beauty with the graces of martial youth. Meleager
saw and, with chivalric reverence, somewhat thus addressed her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For thy name's sake and awe toward thy chaste head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O holiest Atalanta! no man dares<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And godlike for thy grace of hallowed hair<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That make the blown foam neither swift nor white,<br /></span>

</div>

<p>But there was no time then for love; on to the hunt they
pushed. To the hunt went also Plexippus and Toxeus, brothers
of Queen Alth&aelig;a, braggarts, envious of Meleager. Speedily the
hunters drew near the monster's lair. They stretched strong nets
from tree to tree; they uncoupled their dogs; they sought the
footprints of their quarry in the grass. From the wood was a
descent to marshy ground. Here the boar, as he lay among the
reeds, heard the shouts of his pursuers and rushed forth against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>them. One and another is thrown down and slain. Jason, Nestor,
Telamon open the attack, but in vain.</p>

<span class="i0">Hissed, and the moist plumes of the songless reeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved as a wave which the wind moves no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the boar heaved half out of ooze and slime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tense flank trembling round the barb&egrave;d wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hateful; and fiery with invasive eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bristling with intolerable hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plunged, and the hounds clung, and green flowers and white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reddened and broke all round them where they came.[1]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was a slight wound, but Meleager saw and joyfully proclaimed
it. The attack was renewed. Peleus, Amphiara&uuml;s, Theseus, Jason,
hurled their lances. Anc&aelig;us was laid low by a mortal wound.
But Meleager,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rock-rooted, fair with fierce and fastened lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear eyes and springing muscle and shortening limb&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Grave, and with gathered sinews, like a god,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aimed on the left side his well-handled spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grasped where the ash was knottiest hewn, and smote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with no missile wound, the monstrous boar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right in the hairiest hollow of his hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the last rib, sheer through bulk and bone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in; and deeply smitten, and to death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavy horror with his hanging shafts<br /></span>

<p>Then rose a shout from those around; they glorified the
conqueror,&mdash;crowded to touch his hand. But he, placing his foot
upon the head of the slain boar, turned to Atalanta, and bestowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>on her the head and the rough hide&mdash;trophies of his success.

<span class="i0">Lit with a low blush to the braided hair,<br /></span>

<p>Of this fearful sequel to the hunt, Alth&aelig;a has heard nothing.
As she bears thank offering to the temples for the victory of her
son, the bodies of her murdered brothers meet her sight. She
shrieks, and beats her breast, and hastens to change the garments
of joy for those of mourning. But when the author of the deed
is known, grief gives way to the stern desire of vengeance on
her son. The fatal brand, which the Destinies have linked with
Meleager's life, she brings forth. She commands a fire to be prepared.
Four times she essays to place the brand upon the pile;
four times draws back, shuddering before the destruction of her
son. The feelings of the mother and the sister contend within
her. Now she is pale at the thought of the purposed deed, now
flushed again with anger at the violence of her offspring. Finally,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>the sister prevails over the mother:&mdash;turning away her face, she
throws the fatal wood upon the burning pile. Meleager, absent
and unconscious of the cause, feels a sudden pang. He burns;
he calls upon those whom he loves, Atalanta and his mother. But
speedily the brand is ashes, and the life of Meleager is breathed
forth to the wandering winds.</p>

<p>When at last the deed was done, the mother laid violent hands
upon herself.</p>

<p><b>169. Merope.</b> A heroine connected by blood with Atalanta was
Merope,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> daughter of king Cypselus of Arcadia, and descended
from Arcas, the son of Callisto and Jupiter. On account of her
relationship to Atalanta her story may be told here, though she is
not a member of the family of &AElig;tolus. Her husband, Cresphontes
the Heraclid, king of Messenia, had been slain with two of his
sons by rebellious nobles; and one Polyphontes, leader of the
revolt, reigned in his stead and took Merope to wife. But her
third son by Cresphontes, &AElig;pytus, had been concealed by her in
Arcadia. Thence, in due season, he returned unknown to her,
with the purpose of wreaking vengeance on the murderers of his
sire. He pretended to have slain &AElig;pytus, and so as a stranger
won the favor of Polyphontes, but came near losing his life at his
mother's hands. A recognition being happily effected, &AElig;pytus,
aided by his mother, put Polyphontes to death and took possession
of the kingdom. This story has been frequently dramatized, first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>by Euripides in a lost play called Cresphontes, and most recently
by Matthew Arnold, whose Merope is a masterpiece of classical
invention and of poetic execution.</p>

<p><b>170. Castor and Pollux.</b> Leda, the sister of Alth&aelig;a and aunt of
Meleager, bore to Tyndareus, king of Sparta, Castor and Clytemnestra.
To Jove she bore Pollux and Helen. Pollux and Castor&mdash;one,
the son of a god and immortal, the other, of mortal breed
and destiny&mdash;are famous for their fraternal affection. Endowed
with various manly virtues,&mdash;Castor a horse-tamer, Pollux a boxer,&mdash;they
made all expeditions in common. Together they joined
the Calydonian hunt. Together they accompanied the Argonauts.
During the voyage to Colchis it is said that, a storm arising,
Orpheus prayed to the Samothracian gods and played on his harp,
and that when the storm ceased, stars appeared on the heads of the
brothers. Hence they came to be honored as patrons of voyagers.</p>

<p>They rendered, indeed, noteworthy service to the Argonauts
returning from Colchis with Medea and the Golden Fleece. For
when the voyagers attempted a landing at Crete they were confronted
by the gigantic warder of the island. This was Talus, a
form of living brass, fashioned by Heph&aelig;stus (Vulcan) and presented
to King Minos, about whose Cretan domain he made his
rounds three times a day. Ordinarily when Talus saw voyagers
nearing the coast he fired himself red-hot and embraced them as
they landed. For some reason he did not welcome the Argonauts
in this warm fashion, but</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Whirling with resistless sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rocks sheer uprent, repels them from the bay.[1]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Medea, objecting to the volley of stones, resorts to necromantic
spells:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thrice she applies the power of magic prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice, hellward bending, mutters charms in air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, turning toward the foe, bids Mischief fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looks Destruction as she points her eye.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Maddened, as might be surmised, by so insidious and unaccustomed
a form of attack, the Man of Brass "tears up whole hills to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>crush his foes"; then fleeing in sudden panic, he is overcome by
the stupor of the enchantment and taken captive by Castor and
Pollux. He had in his body only one vein, and that plugged on
the crown of his head with a nail. Medea drew out the stopper.</p>

<p>At a later period when Theseus and his friend Piritho&uuml;s had
carried off Helen from Sparta, the youthful heroes, Castor and
Pollux, with their followers hasted to the rescue. Theseus being
absent from Attica, the brothers recovered their sister. Later still,
we find Castor and Pollux engaged in a combat with Idas and
Lynceus of Messene, some say over the daughters of Leucippus,
others, over a herd of oxen. Castor was slain; but Pollux, inconsolable
for the loss of his brother, besought Jupiter to be permitted
to give his own life as a ransom for him. Jupiter so far consented
as to allow the two brothers to enjoy the boon of life alternately,
each spending one day under the earth and the next in the heavenly
abodes. According to another version, Jupiter rewarded the
attachment of the brothers by placing them among the stars as
Gemini, the Twins. They received heroic honors as the <i>Tyndarid&aelig;</i>
(sons of Tyndareus); divine honors they received under the name
of <i>Dioscuri</i> (sons of Jove).<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<span class="ph4">THE HOUSE OF MINOS</span></h3>


<p><b>172. Minos of Crete</b> was a descendant of Inachus in the sixth
generation. A son of Jupiter and Europa, he was, after death,
transferred, with his brother Rhadamanthus and with King &AElig;acus,
to Hades, where the three became judges of the Shades. This is
the Minos mentioned by Homer and Hesiod,&mdash;the eminent lawgiver.
Of his grandson, Minos II, it is related that when aiming
at the crown of Crete, he boasted of his power to obtain by prayer
whatever he desired, and as a test, he implored Neptune to send
him a bull for sacrifice. The bull appeared, but Minos, astonished
at its great beauty, declined to sacrifice the brute. Neptune, therefore
incensed, drove the bull wild,&mdash;worse still, drove Pasipha&euml;,
the wife of Minos, wild with love of it. The wonderful brute was
finally caught and overcome by Hercules, who rode it through the
waves to Greece. But its offspring, the Minotaur, a monster bull-headed
and man-bodied, remained for many a day a terror to
Crete, till finally a famous artificer, D&aelig;dalus, constructed for
him a labyrinth, with passages and turnings winding in and about
like the river M&aelig;ander, so that whoever was inclosed in it might
by no means find his way out. The Minotaur, roaming therein,
lived upon human victims. For it is said that, after Minos had
subdued Megara,<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> a tribute of seven youths and seven maidens
was sent every year from Athens to Crete to feed this monster;
and it was not until the days of Theseus of Athens that an end
was put to both tribute and Minotaur.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p><b>173. D&aelig;dalus and Icarus.</b><a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> D&aelig;dalus, who abetted the love
of Pasipha&euml; for the Cretan bull, afterwards lost the favor of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>Minos and was imprisoned by him. Seeing no other way of
escape, the artificer made, out of feathers, wings for his son
Icarus and himself, which he fastened
on with wax. Then poising
themselves in the air, they flew away.
Icarus had been warned not to approach
too near the sun, and all went
well till they had passed Samos and
Delos on the left and Lebynthos on
the right. But then the boy, exulting
in his career, soared upward.
The blaze of the torrid sun softened
the waxen fastening of his wings.
Off they came, and down the lad
dropped into the sea which after him
is named Icarian, even to this day.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The story, save for its tragic conclusion, reads like a remarkable anticipation
of the exploits of the Wright brothers, Bl&eacute;riot, and Latham
with the a&euml;roplane to-day, or of Count Zeppelin with his airships.</p>

<p>D&aelig;dalus, mourning his son, arrived finally in Sicily where,
being kindly received by King Cocalus, he built a temple to
Apollo and hung up his wings, an offering to the god. But
Minos, having learned of the hiding place of the artificer, followed
him to Sicily with a great fleet; and D&aelig;dalus would surely
have perished, had not one of the daughters of Cocalus disposed
of Minos by scalding him to death while he was bathing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>
<p>It is said that D&aelig;dalus could not bear the idea of a rival. His
sister had placed her son Perdix under his charge to be taught the
mechanical arts. He was an apt scholar and gave striking evidences
of ingenuity. Walking on the seashore, he picked up the
spine of a fish, and, imitating it in iron, invented the saw. He
invented, also, a pair of compasses. But D&aelig;dalus, envious of his
nephew, pushed him off a tower and killed him. Minerva, however,
in pity of the boy, changed him into a bird, the partridge,
which bears his name.</p>

<p>To the descendants of Inachus we shall again return in the
account of the house of Labdacus.</p>

<p><b>174. From Cecrops<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> to Philomela.</b> Cecrops, half-snake, half-man,
came from Crete or Egypt into Attica, founded Athens, and
chose Minerva rather than Neptune as its guardian. His successor
was Erichthonius,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> or Erechtheus, a snake-formed genius of the
fertile soil of Attica. This
Erichthonius<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> was a special
ward of the goddess
Minerva, who brought
him up in her temple.
His son Pandion had two
daughters, Procne and
Philomela, of whom he
gave the former in marriage
to Tereus, king of
Thrace (or of Daulis in
Phocis). This ruler, after
his wife had borne him
a son Itys (or Itylus),
wearied of her, plucked
out her tongue by the roots to insure her silence, and, pretending
that she was dead, took in marriage the other sister, Philomela.
Procne by means of a web, into which she wove her story, informed
Philomela of the horrible truth. In revenge upon Tereus,
the sisters killed Itylus and served up the child as food to the
father; but the gods, in indignation, transformed Procne into a
swallow, Philomela into a nightingale, forever bemoaning the murdered
Itylus, and Tereus into a hawk, forever pursuing the sisters.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>According to another version of this story, it was Philomela
who was robbed of her tongue and who wove the web by means
of which the queen Procne learned the truth.</p>

<p><b>176. Theseus.</b><a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> A descendant of Erechtheus, or of Cecrops, was
&AElig;geus, king of Athens. By &AElig;thra, granddaughter of Pelops, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>became the father of the Attic hero, Theseus. &AElig;geus, on parting
from &AElig;thra, before the birth of the child, had placed his sword
and shoes under a large stone and had directed her to send the
child to him if it should prove strong enough to roll away the
stone and take what was under. The lad Theseus was brought up
at Tr&oelig;zen, of which Pittheus, &AElig;thra's father, was king. When
&AElig;thra thought the time had come, she led Theseus to the stone.
He removed it with ease and took the sword and shoes. Since at
that time the roads
were infested with robbers,
his grandfather
Pittheus pressed him
earnestly to take the
shorter and safer way
to his father's country,
by sea; but the youth,
feeling in himself the
spirit and soul of a
hero and eager to
signalize himself like
Hercules, determined
on the more perilous
and adventurous journey
by land.</p>

</div>

<p>His first day's journey
brought him to
Epidaurus, where dwelt Periphetes, a son of Vulcan. This ferocious
savage always went armed with a club of iron, and all travelers
stood in terror of his violence; but beneath the blows of the
young hero he speedily fell.</p>

<p>Several similar contests with the petty tyrants and marauders of
the country followed, in all of which Theseus was victorious. Most
important was his slaughter of Procrustes, or the Stretcher. This
giant had an iron bedstead on which he used to tie all travelers
who fell into his hands. If they were shorter than the bed, he
stretched them till they fitted it; if they were longer than the bed,
he lopped off their limbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>In the course of time Theseus reached Athens, but here new
dangers awaited him. For Medea, the sorceress, who had fled
from Corinth after her separation from Jason,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> had become the
wife of &AElig;geus. Knowing by her arts who the stranger was, and
fearing the loss of her influence with her husband if Theseus
should be acknowledged as his son, she tried to poison the
youth; but the sword which he wore discovered him to his father
and prevented the fatal
draft. Medea fled to
Asia, where the country
afterwards called Media
is said to have received
its name from her.
Theseus was acknowledged
by his sire and
declared successor to
the throne.</p>

Athenians were at that
time in deep affliction
on account of the tribute
of youths and maidens
which they were
forced to send to the
Minotaur, dwelling in
the labyrinth of Crete,&mdash;a
penalty said to have
been imposed by Minos upon the Athenians because &AElig;geus had
sent Androge&uuml;s, the son of Minos, against the Marathonian bull
and so had brought about the young man's death.</p>

<p>From this calamity Theseus resolved to deliver his countrymen
or to die in the attempt. He, therefore, in spite of the entreaties
of his father, presented himself as champion of Athens and of her
fair sons and daughters, to do battle against the Minotaur, and
departed with the victims in a vessel bearing black sails, which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>promised his father to change for white in the event of his returning
victorious. So,&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Like some myrtle set by streaming ways of Eurotas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to the varied tints that Spring invites with her breezes,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as with eager gaze she looked her first upon Theseus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never a whit she lowered her eyes nor ceased to consume him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere to the core profound her breast with love was enkindled.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Not unaided, however, did he undertake the task; for Ariadne,
apprehensive lest he might lose his way in the d&aelig;dalian labyrinth,
furnished him with a thread, the gift of Vulcan, which, unrolled
by Theseus as he entered the maze, should enable him on his return
to retrace his former path. Meanwhile&mdash;</p>

<p>So the grieving, much-wronged Ariadne was consoled for the
loss of her mortal spouse by an immortal lover. The blooming god
of the vine wooed and won her. After her death, the golden crown
that he had given her was transferred by him to the heavens. As
it mounted the ethereal spaces, its gems, growing in brightness,
became stars; and still it remains fixed, as a constellation, between
the kneeling Hercules and the man that holds the serpent.</p>

<p><b>179. The Amazons.</b> As king of Athens, it is said that Theseus
undertook an expedition against the Amazons. Assailing them
before they had recovered from the attack of Hercules, he carried
off their queen Antiope; but they in turn, invading the country
of Athens, penetrated into the city itself; and there was fought
the final battle in which Theseus overcame them.</p>

<p><b>180. Theseus and Piritho&uuml;s.</b> A famous friendship between
Theseus and Piritho&uuml;s of Thessaly, son of Jupiter, originated in
the midst of arms. Piritho&uuml;s had made an irruption into the plain
of Marathon and had carried off the herds of the king of Athens.
Theseus went to repel the plunderers. The moment the Thessalian
beheld him, he was seized with admiration, and stretching out his
hand as a token of peace, he cried, "Be judge thyself,&mdash;what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>satisfaction dost thou require?"&mdash;"Thy friendship," replied the
Athenian; and they swore inviolable fidelity. Their deeds corresponding
to their professions, they continued true brothers in
arms. When, accordingly, Piritho&uuml;s was to marry Hippodamia,
daughter of Atrax, Theseus took his friend's part in the battle
that ensued between the Lapith&aelig; (of whom Piritho&uuml;s was king)
and the Centaurs. For it happened that at the marriage feast, the
Centaurs were among the guests; and one of them, Eurytion, becoming
intoxicated, attempted to offer violence to the bride. Other
Centaurs followed his example; combat was joined; Theseus leaped
into the fray, and not a
few of the guests bit the
dust.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 145. Lapith and Centaur</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Later, each of these
friends aspired to espouse
a daughter of Jupiter.
Theseus fixed his choice
on Leda's daughter Helen,
then a child, but afterwards
famous as the cause
of the Trojan War; and
with the aid of his friend
he carried her off, only,
however, to restore her
at very short notice. As
for Piritho&uuml;s, he aspired
to the wife of the monarch of Erebus; and Theseus, though aware
of the danger, accompanied the ambitious lover to the underworld.
But Pluto seized and set them on an enchanted rock at his palace
gate, where fixed they remained till Hercules, arriving, liberated
Theseus but left Piritho&uuml;s to his fate.</p>

<p><b>181. Ph&aelig;dra and Hippolytus.</b> After the death of Antiope,
Theseus married Ph&aelig;dra, sister of the deserted Ariadne, daughter
of Minos. But Ph&aelig;dra, seeing in Hippolytus, the son of Theseus,
a youth endowed with all the graces and virtues of his father and
of an age corresponding to her own, loved him. When, however,
he repulsed her advances, her love was changed to despair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
hate. Hanging herself, she left for her husband a scroll containing
false charges against Hippolytus. The infatuated husband, filled,
therefore, with jealousy of his son, imprecated the vengeance of
Neptune upon him. As Hippolytus one day drove his chariot
along the shore, a sea monster raised himself above the waters
and frightened the horses so that they ran away and dashed the
chariot to pieces. Hippolytus was killed, but by &AElig;sculapius was
restored to life, and then, removed by Diana from the power of his
deluded father, was placed in Italy under the protection of the
nymph Egeria.</p>

<p>In his old age, Theseus, losing the favor of his people, retired
to the court of Lycomedes, king of Scyros, who at first received
him kindly, but afterwards treacherously put him to death.</p>

<span class="ph4">THE HOUSE OF LABDACUS</span></h3>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 146. &OElig;dipus and the Sphinx</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><b>182. The Misfortunes of Thebes.</b> Returning to the descendants
of Inachus, we find that the curse which fell upon Cadmus when
he slew the dragon of Mars followed nearly every scion of his
house. His daughters, Semele, Ino, Autono&euml;, Agave,&mdash;his grandsons,
Melicertes, Act&aelig;on, Pentheus,&mdash;lived sorrowful lives or
suffered violent deaths. The
misfortunes of one branch of
his family, sprung from his son
Polydorus, remain to be told.
The curse seems to have spared
Polydorus himself. His son
Labdacus, also, lived a quiet
life as king of Thebes and left
a son, La&iuml;us, upon the throne.
But erelong La&iuml;us was warned
by an oracle that there was danger
to his throne and life if
his son, new-born, should reach
man's estate. He, therefore,
committed the child to a herdsman
with orders for its destruction; but the herdsman, moved
with pity yet not daring entirely to disobey, pierced the child's
feet, purposing to expose him to the elements on Mount Cith&aelig;ron.</p>

<p><b>183. &OElig;dipus and the Sphinx.</b><a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> In this plight the infant was
given to a tender-hearted fellow-shepherd, who carried him to
King Polybus of Corinth and his queen, by whom he was adopted
and called &OElig;dipus, or Swollen-foot.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>
<p>Many years afterward, &OElig;dipus, learning from an oracle that he
was destined to be the death of his father, left the realm of his
reputed sire, Polybus. It happened, however, that La&iuml;us was then
driving to Delphi, accompanied only by one attendant. In a narrow
road he met &OElig;dipus, also in a chariot. On the refusal of the youthful
stranger to leave the way at their command, the attendant killed
one of his horses. &OElig;dipus, consumed with rage, slew both La&iuml;us
and the attendant, and thus unknowingly fulfilled both oracles.</p>

<p>Shortly after this event, the city of Thebes, to which &OElig;dipus
had repaired, was afflicted with a monster that infested the high-road.
She was called the Sphinx. She had the body of a lion and
the upper part of a woman. She lay crouched on the top of a rock
and, arresting all travelers who came that way, propounded to
them a riddle, with the condition that those who could solve it
should pass safe, but those who failed should be killed. Not one
had yet succeeded in guessing it. &OElig;dipus, not daunted by these
alarming accounts, boldly advanced to the trial. The Sphinx asked
him, "What animal is it that in the morning goes on four feet, at
noon on two, and in the evening upon three?" &OElig;dipus replied,
"Man, who in childhood creeps on hands and knees, in manhood
walks erect, and in old age goes with the aid of a staff." The
Sphinx, mortified at the collapse of her riddle, cast herself down
from the rock and perished.</p>

<p><b>184. &OElig;dipus, the King.</b> In gratitude for their deliverance, the
Thebans made &OElig;dipus their king, giving him in marriage their
queen, Jocasta. He, ignorant of his parentage, had already become
the slayer of his father; in marrying the queen he became the
husband of his mother. These horrors remained undiscovered till,
after many years, Thebes being afflicted with famine and pestilence,
the oracle was consulted, and, by a series of coincidences, the double
crime of &OElig;dipus came to light. At once, Jocasta put an end to
her life by hanging herself. As for &OElig;dipus, horror-struck,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">When her form<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw, poor wretch! with one wild fearful cry,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On those whom they ought never to have seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor know the dear ones whom he fain had known."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With suchlike wails, not once or twice alone,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><b>185. &OElig;dipus at Colonus.</b> After these sad events &OElig;dipus would
have left Thebes, but the oracle forbade the people to let him go.
Jocasta's brother, Creon, was made regent of the realm for the two
sons of &OElig;dipus. But after &OElig;dipus had grown content to stay,
these sons of his, with Creon, thrust him into exile. Accompanied
by his daughter Antigone, he went begging through the land. His
other daughter, Ismene, at first stayed at home. Cursing the sons
who had abandoned him, but bowing his own will in submission to
the ways of God, &OElig;dipus approached the hour of his death in
Colonus, a village near Athens. His friend Theseus, king of
Athens, comforted and sustained him to the last. Both his daughters
were also with him:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then he called his girls, and bade them fetch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear water from the stream, and bring to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For cleansing and libation. And they went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both of them, to yon hill we look upon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Owned by Demeter of the fair green corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quickly did his bidding, bathed his limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clothed them in the garment that is meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he had his will in all they did,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not one wish continued unfulfilled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zeus from the dark depths thundered, and the girls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard it, and shuddering, at their father's knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falling they wept; nor did they then forbear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiting their breasts, nor groanings lengthened out;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he heard their bitter cry, forthwith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Folding his arms around them, thus he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My children, on this day ye cease to have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A father. All my days are spent and gone;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And ye no more shall lead your wretched life,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My children! Yet one word is strong to loose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although alone, the burden of these toils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For <i>love</i> in larger store ye could not have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From any than from him who standeth here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom bereaved ye now shall live your life."<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was sobbing, then silence. Then a voice called him,&mdash;and
he followed. God took him from his troubles. Antigone
returned to Thebes,&mdash;where, as we shall see, her sisterly fidelity
showed itself as true as, aforetime, her filial affection.</p>

<p>Her brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, had meanwhile agreed to
share the kingdom between them and to reign alternately year by
year. The first year fell to the lot of Eteocles, who, when his
time expired, refused to surrender the kingdom to his brother.
Polynices, accordingly, fled to Adrastus, king of Argos, who gave
him his daughter in marriage and aided him with an army to
enforce his claim to the kingdom. These causes led to the celebrated
expedition of the "Seven against Thebes," which furnished
ample materials for the epic and tragic poets of Greece. And
here the younger heroes of Greece make their appearance.</p>

<span class="ph4">MYTHS OF THE YOUNGER HEROES: THE SEVEN
AGAINST THEBES</span></h3>


<p><b>186. Their Exploits.</b> The exploits of the sons and grandsons
of the chieftains engaged in the Calydonian Hunt and the Quest
of the Golden Fleece are narrated in four stories,&mdash;the Seven
against Thebes, the Siege of Troy, the Wanderings of Ulysses,
and the Adventures of &AElig;neas.</p>

<p><b>187. The Seven against Thebes.</b><a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> The allies of Adrastus and
Polynices in the enterprise against Thebes were Tydeus of Calydon,
half brother of Meleager, Parthenop&aelig;us of Arcadia, son of
Atalanta and Mars, Capaneus of Argos, Hippomedon of Argos, and
Amphiara&uuml;s, the brother-in-law of Adrastus. Amphiara&uuml;s opposed
the expedition for, being a soothsayer, he knew that none of the
leaders except Adrastus would live to return from Thebes; but on
his marriage to Eriphyle, the king's sister, he had agreed that
whenever he and Adrastus should differ in opinion, the decision
should be left to Eriphyle. Polynices, knowing this, gave Eriphyle
the necklace of Harmonia and thereby gained her to his interest.
This was the selfsame necklace that Vulcan had given to Harmonia
on her marriage with Cadmus; Polynices had taken it with
him on his flight from Thebes. It seems to have been still fraught
with the curse of the house of Cadmus. But Eriphyle could not
resist so tempting a bribe. By her decision the war was resolved
on, and Amphiara&uuml;s went to his fate. He bore his part bravely
in the contest, but still could not avert his destiny. While, pursued
by the enemy, he was fleeing along the river, a thunderbolt
launched by Jupiter opened the ground, and he, his chariot, and
his charioteer were swallowed up.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p>It is unnecessary here to detail all the acts of heroism or atrocity
which marked this contest. The fidelity, however, of Evadne
stands out as an offset to the weakness of Eriphyle. Her husband,
Capaneus, having in the ardor of the fight declared that he
would force his way into the city in spite of Jove himself, placed
a ladder against the wall and mounted; but Jupiter, offended at
his impious language, struck him with a thunderbolt. When his
obsequies were celebrated, Evadne cast herself on his funeral pile
and perished.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 147. Eteocles and Polynices kill</span>

</div>

<p>It seems that early in the contest Eteocles consulted the soothsayer
Tiresias as to the issue. Now, this Tiresias in his youth had
by chance seen Minerva bathing, and had been deprived by her
of his sight, but afterwards had obtained of her the knowledge of
future events. When
consulted by Eteocles,
he declared that victory
should fall to
Thebes if Men&oelig;ceus,
the son of Creon, gave
himself a voluntary victim.
The heroic youth,
learning the response,
threw away his life in
the first encounter.</p>

<p>The siege continued
long, with varying success.
At length both
hosts agreed that the brothers should decide their quarrel by single
combat. They fought, and fell each by the hand of the other. The
armies then renewed the fight; and at last the invaders were forced
to yield, and fled, leaving their dead unburied. Creon, the uncle of
the fallen princes, now became king, caused Eteocles to be buried
with distinguished honor, but suffered the body of Polynices to lie
where it fell, forbidding any one, on pain of death, to give it burial.</p>

<p><b>188. Antigone</b>,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> the sister of Polynices, heard with indignation
the revolting edict which, consigning her brother's body to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>the dogs and vultures, deprived it of the rites that were considered
essential to the repose of the dead. Unmoved by the dissuading
counsel of her affectionate but timid sister, and unable to
procure assistance, she determined to brave the hazard and to
bury the body with her own hands. She was detected in the act.
When Creon asked the fearless woman whether she dared disobey
the laws, she answered:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes, for it was not Zeus who gave them forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor justice, dwelling with the gods below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who traced these laws for all the sons of men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did I deem thy edicts strong enough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou, a mortal man, should'st overpass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unwritten laws of God that know no change.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are not of to-day nor yesterday,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But live forever, nor can man assign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first they sprang to being. Not through fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of any man's resolve was I prepared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the gods to bear the penalty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sinning against these. That I should die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew (how should I not?), though thy decree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had never spoken. And before my time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I shall die, I reckon this a gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whoso lives, as I, in many woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can it be but he shall gain by death?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so for me to bear this doom of thine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has nothing fearful. But, if I had left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother's son unburied on his death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that I should have suffered; but in this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I suffer not.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Creon, unyielding and unable to conceive of a law higher than that
he knew, gave orders that she should be buried alive, as having
deliberately set at nought the solemn edict of the city. Her lover,
H&aelig;mon, the son of Creon, unable to avert her fate, would not
survive her, and fell by his own hand. It is only after his son's
death and as he gazes upon the corpses of the lovers, that the
aged Creon recognizes the insolence of his narrow judgment.

wedding gear of Harmonia has not yet fulfilled its baleful mission.
Amphiara&uuml;s had, with his last breath, enjoined his son Alcm&aelig;on
to avenge him on the faithless Eriphyle. Alcm&aelig;on engaged his
word, but before accomplishing the fell purpose, he was ordered
by an oracle of Delphi to conduct against Thebes a new expedition.
Thereto his mother Eriphyle, influenced by Thersander, the son
of Polynices, and bribed this time by the gift of Harmonia's wedding
garment, impelled not only Alcm&aelig;on but her other son,
Amphilochus. The descendants (<i>Epigoni</i>) of the former Seven
thus renewed the war against Thebes. They leveled the city to the
ground. Its inhabitants, counseled by Tiresias, took refuge in foreign
lands. Tiresias himself perished during the flight. Alcm&aelig;on,
returning to Argos, put his mother to death but, in consequence,
repeated in his own experience the penalty of Orestes. The outfit
of Harmonia preserved its malign influence until, at last, it was
devoted to the temple at Delphi and removed from the sphere of
mortal jealousies.</p>

<span class="ph4">HOUSES CONCERNED IN THE TROJAN WAR</span></h3>


<p><b>190. Three Families.</b> Before entering upon the causes of the war
against Troy, we must notice the three Grecian families that were
principally concerned,&mdash;those of Peleus, Atreus, and Tyndareus.</p>

<p><b>191. Peleus</b><a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> was the son of &AElig;acus and grandson of Jove. It
was for his father &AElig;acus, king of Phthia in Thessaly, that, as we
have seen, an army of Myrmidons was created by Jupiter. Peleus
joined the expedition of the Argonauts, and on that journey beheld
and fell in love with the sea-nymph Thetis, daughter of Nereus
and Doris. Such was the beauty of the nymph that Jupiter himself
had sought her in marriage; but having learned from Prometheus,
the Titan, that Thetis should bear a son who should be
greater than his father, the Olympian desisted from his suit and
decreed that Thetis should be the wife of a mortal. By the aid of
Chiron, the Centaur, Peleus succeeded in winning the goddess for
his bride. In this marriage, to be productive of momentous results
for mortals, the immortals manifested a lively interest. They
thronged with the Thessalians to the wedding in Pharsalia; they
honored the wedding feast with their presence and, reclining on
ivory couches, gave ear while the three Sisters of Fate, in responsive
strain, chanted the fortunes of Achilles,&mdash;the future hero
of the Trojan War,&mdash;the son that should spring from this union
of a goddess with a mortal. The following is from a translation of
the famous poem, The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis:<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... Now, on the day foreset, Aurora forsaking the ocean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crimsons the orient sky: all Thessaly, seeking the palace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fares to the royal seat, in populous muster exultant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy of hand with gifts, but blithesome of cheer for the joyance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scyros behind they leave, they leave Phthiotican Tempe,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Crannon's glittering domes and the battlements Lariss&aelig;an,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cumber Pharsalia, throng the abodes and the streets of Pharsalus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fields, meanwhile are untilled, grow tender the necks of the oxen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None with the curving teeth of the harrow cleareth the vineyard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None upturneth the glebe with bull and the furrowing plowshare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None with gardener's knife lets light through the branches umbrageous;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Squalid the rust creeps up o'er plows forgotten of plowmen.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Bright is the palace, ay, through far retreating recesses<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blazing for sheen benign of the opulent gold and the silver:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ivory gleams on the thrones, great goblets glint on the tables,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glitters the spacious home, made glad with imperial splendor,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ay, but most&mdash;in the hall midmost&mdash;is the couch of the goddess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glorious, made of the tusk of the Indian elephant&mdash;polished&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread with a wonder of quilt empurpled with dye of the sea-shell.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On this coverlet of purple were embroidered various scenes illustrating
the lessons of heroism and justice that the poet would
inculcate: to the good falleth good; to the evil, evil speedily.
Therefore, the story of Theseus and Ariadne, which has already
been recounted, was here displayed in cunning handiwork. For
Theseus, the false lover, bold of hand but bad of heart, gained by
retributive justice undying ruth and misery; whereas Ariadne, the
injured and innocent, restored to happiness, won no less a reward
than Bacchus himself. Gorgeously woven with such antique and
heroic figures was the famous quilt upon the couch of Thetis. For
a season the wedding guests feasted their eyes upon it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then when Thessaly's youth, long gazing, had of the wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their content, they gan give place to the lords of Olympus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when Zephyr awakes the recumbent billows of ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roughens the placid deep with eager breath of the morning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urges the waves, and impels, to the threshold of journeying Ph&oelig;bus,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They, at first, blown outward unroughly when Dawn is a-rising,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Limp slow-footed, and loiter with laughter lightsomely plashing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, with the freshening gale, creep quicker and thicker together,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till on horizon they float refulgent of luminous purple,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So from the portal withdrawing the pomp Thessalian departed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faring on world-wide ways to the far-off homes of their fathers.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now when they were aloof, drew nigh from Pelion's summit<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Chiron bearing gifts from copses and glades of the woodland&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gifts that the meadows yield: what flowers on Thessaly's mountains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, by waves of the stream, the prolific breath of the West Wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warming, woos to the day, all such in bunches assorted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bore he. Flattered with odors the whole house brake into laughter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came there next Pene&uuml;s, abandoning verdurous Tempe&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tempe embowered deep mid superimpendent forests.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And after the river-god, who bore with him nodding plane trees
and lofty beeches, straight slim laurels, the lithe poplar, and the
airy cypress to plant about the palace that thick foliage might give
it shade, followed Prometheus, the bold and cunning of heart,
wearing still the marks of his ancient punishment on the rocks of
Caucasus. Finally the father of the gods himself came, with his
holy spouse and his offspring,&mdash;all, save Ph&oelig;bus and his one
sister, who naturally looked askance upon a union to be productive
of untold misfortune to their favored town of Troy.</p>

<p><b>192. Achilles, Son of Peleus.</b> So the sisters prophesied the
future of the hero, Achilles,&mdash;from his father called Pelides;
from his grandfather, &AElig;acides. How by him the Trojans should
fall, as fall the ears of corn when they are yellow before the
scythe; how because of him Scamander should run red, warm with
blood, choked with blind bodies, into the whirling Hellespont;
how finally he himself, in his prime, should fall, and how on his
tomb should be sacrificed the fair Polyxena, daughter of Priam,
whom he had loved. "So," says Catullus, "sang the Fates. For
those were the days before piety and righteous action were spurned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
by mankind, the days when Jupiter and his immortals deigned to
consort with zealous man, to enjoy the sweet odor of his burnt-offering,
to march beside him to battle, to swell his shout in victory
and his lament in defeat, to smile on his peaceful harvests, to
recline at his banquets, and to bless the weddings of fair women
and goodly heroes. But now, alas," concludes Catullus, "godliness
and chastity, truth, wisdom, and honor have departed from among
men":</p>

<p>The hero of the Trojan War, here prophesied, <b>Achilles</b>, fleet of
foot, the dauntless, the noble, the beloved of Zeus, the breaker of the
ranks of men, is the ideal hero of the Greeks,&mdash;the mightiest of the
Ach&aelig;ans far. Of his youth many interesting stories are told: how
his mother, endeavoring to make him invulnerable, plunged him in
the river Styx, and succeeded save with regard to his ankles by which
she held him; and how he was educated in eloquence and the
arts of war by his father's friend Ph&oelig;nix, and by his father's other
friend Chiron, the centaur, in riding and hunting and music and the
art of healing. One of the most Greek-minded of our English poets,
Matthew Arnold,<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> singing of a beauteous dell by Etna, tells how</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In such a glen, on such a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Pelion, on the grassy ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chiron, the aged Centaur, lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young Achilles standing by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Centaur taught him to explore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountains; where the glens are dry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tired Centaurs come to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the soaking springs abound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the straight ashes grow for spears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the hill goats come to feed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sea eagles build their nest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He showed him Phthia far away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, "O boy, I taught this lore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Peleus, in long distant years!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He told him of the gods, the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tides;&mdash;and then of mortal wars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the life which heroes lead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before they reach the Elysian place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rest in the immortal mead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the wisdom of his race.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Upon the character of Achilles, outspoken, brave, impulsive; to
his friends passionately devoted, to his foes implacable; lover of war
and lover of home; inordinately ambitious but submissive to divine
decree;&mdash;upon this handsome, gleaming, terrible, glooming,
princely warrior of his race, the poet of the Iliad delights to dwell,
and the world has delighted in the portraiture from that day to this.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>
<p><b>193. Atreus</b> was the son of Pelops and Hippodamia and grandson
of Tantalus, therefore great-grandson of Jove. Both by blood
and by marriage he was connected with Theseus. He took to wife
A&euml;rope, granddaughter of Minos II, king of Crete, and by her
had two sons, Agamemnon, the general of the Grecian army in
the Trojan War, and Menela&uuml;s, at whose solicitation the war was
undertaken. Of Atreus it may be said that with cannibal atrocity
like that of his grandsire, Tantalus, he on one occasion wreaked
his vengeance on a brother, Thyestes, by causing him to eat the
flesh of two of his own children. A son of this Thyestes, &AElig;gisthus
by name, revived in due time against Agamemnon the treacherous
feud that had existed between their fathers.</p>

<p><b>194. Tyndareus</b> was king of Laced&aelig;mon (Sparta). His wife
was Leda, daughter of Thestius of Calydon, and sister of Alth&aelig;a,
the mother of Meleager and Dejanira. To Tyndareus Leda bore
Castor and Clytemnestra; to Jove she bore Pollux and Helen. The
two former were mortal; the two latter, immortal. Clytemnestra
was married to Agamemnon of Mycen&aelig;, to whom she bore Electra,
Iphigenia, Chrysothemis, and Orestes. Helen, the fair immediate
cause of the Trojan War, became the wife of Menela&uuml;s, who
with her obtained the kingdom of Sparta.</p>

<p>Of the families of Peleus, Atreus, and Tyndareus, the genealogies
will be found in the Commentary corresponding with these
sections of the story; also the genealogy of Ulysses, one of the
leaders of the Greek army during the war and the hero of the
Odyssey, which narrates his subsequent adventures; and that of
the royal family of Troy against whom the war was undertaken.
A slight study of these family trees will reveal interesting relationships
between the principal participants in the war. For instance:
that the passionate Achilles and the intolerant Ajax, second only
to Achilles in military prowess, are first cousins; and that the
family of Ajax is connected by marriage with that of the Trojan
Hector, whom he meets in combat. That Ulysses is a distant
cousin of his wife Penelope and of Clytemnestra, the wife of
Agamemnon; and that he is a kinsman of Patroclus, the bosom
friend of Achilles. In the family of Tyndareus we note most the
tragic and romantic careers of the women,&mdash;Clytemnestra, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
murdered her husband and married his cousin &AElig;gisthus; Helen,
whose beauty provoked war between her two husbands and their
races; Penelope, whose fidelity to her absent lord is the marvel of
the Odyssey. It will be noticed, too, that the daughter of Helen,
Hermione, is strangely enough married first by the son of Achilles
and, afterwards, by the son of Agamemnon, and so becomes sister-in-law
to her noble cousins, Electra and Iphigenia.</p>

<p>The kinsmen and descendants of Peleus&mdash;Telamon, Ajax,
Teucer, Achilles, Neoptolemus&mdash;are characterized by their personal
valor, their intolerant and resentful temper. In the family of
Atreus, the men are remarkable for their kingly attributes; the
principal women for their unwavering devotion to religious duty.
The members of the royal family of Troy are of richly varied and
most unusual individuality: like Tithonus and Memnon, Paris,
Hesione, Cassandra and Polyxena, poetic and pathetic; like Laomedon,
Priam, Hector and Troilus, patriotic, persistent in the face
of overwhelming odds; but all fated to a dolorous end. Of
those engaged in the Trojan War, &AElig;neas and his aged father,
Anchises, beloved of Venus, are practically the only survivors to a
happier day.</p>

<p><b>195. Its Origin.</b> At the nuptials of Peleus and Thetis all the
gods had been invited with the exception of Eris, or Discord.
Enraged at her exclusion, the goddess threw a golden apple among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>the guests, with the inscription, "For the fairest." Thereupon
Juno, Venus, and Minerva each claimed the apple. Not willing
to decide so delicate a matter, Jupiter sent the goddesses to Mount
Ida where Paris, son of Priam, king of Troy, was tending his
flocks. Till that moment the shepherd-prince had been happy.
He was young and beautiful and beloved,&mdash;"White-breasted like a
star," says &OElig;none, the nymph whom he had wedded:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">White-breasted like a star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fronting the dawn he moved; a leopard skin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dropp'd from his shoulder, but his sunny hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cluster'd about his temples like a god's:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his cheek brighten'd as the foam-bow brightens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the wind blows the foam, and all my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went forth to embrace him coming ere he came.[1]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But to him was now committed the judgment between the goddesses.
They appeared:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And at their feet the crocus brake like fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Violet, amaracus, and asphodel,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And overhead the wandering ivy and vine,<br /></span>

<p>Juno promised him power and riches, Minerva glory and renown
in war, Venus the fairest of women for his wife,&mdash;each attempting
to bias the judge in her own favor. Paris, forgetting the fair
nymph to whom he owed fealty, decided in favor of Venus, thus
making the two other goddesses his enemies. Under the protection
of the goddess of love, he soon afterwards sailed to Greece. Here
he was hospitably received by Menela&uuml;s, whose wife, Helen, as
fairest of her sex, was unfortunately the prize destined for Paris.
This fair queen had in time past been sought by numerous suitors;
but before her decision was made known, they all, at the suggestion
of Ulysses, son of La&euml;rtes, king of Ithaca, had taken an oath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>that they would sustain her choice and avenge her cause if necessary.
She was living happily with Menela&uuml;s when Paris, becoming
their guest, made love to her, and then, aided by Venus, persuaded
her to elope with him, and carried her to Troy. From this cause
arose the famous Trojan War,&mdash;the theme of the greatest poems
of antiquity, those of
Homer and Virgil.</p>

</div>

<p>Menela&uuml;s called
upon the chieftains
of Greece to aid him
in recovering his wife.
They came forward
with a few exceptions.
Ulysses, for instance,
who had married a
cousin of Helen's,
Penelope, daughter of
Icarius, was happy in
his wife and child,
and loth to embark in
the troublesome affair.
Palamedes was sent to
urge him. But when
Palamedes arrived at
Ithaca, Ulysses pretended
madness. He
yoked an ass and an
ox together to the plow and began to sow salt. The ambassador, to
try him, placed the infant Telemachus before the plow, whereupon
the father, turning the plow aside, showed that his insanity was a
mere pretense. Being himself gained for the undertaking, Ulysses
lent his aid to bring in other reluctant chiefs, especially Achilles,
son of Peleus and Thetis. Thetis being herself one of the immortals,
and knowing that her son was fated to perish before Troy if
he went on the expedition, endeavored to prevent his going. She,
accordingly, sent him to the court of King Lycomedes of the island
of Scyros, and induced him to conceal himself in the garb of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
maiden among the daughters of the king. Hearing that the young
Achilles was there, Ulysses went disguised as a merchant to the
palace and offered for sale female ornaments, among which had
been placed some arms. Forgetting the part he had assumed,
Achilles handled the weapons and thereby betrayed himself to
Ulysses, who found no great difficulty in persuading him to disregard
his mother's counsels and join his countrymen in the war.</p>

<p>It seems that from early youth Paris had been reared in obscurity,
because there were forebodings that he would be the ruin of
the state. These forebodings appeared, at last, likely to be realized;
for the Grecian armament now in preparation was the greatest that
had ever been fitted out. Agamemnon, king of Mycen&aelig; and brother
of Menela&uuml;s, was chosen commander in chief. Pre&euml;minent among
the warriors was the swift-footed Achilles. After him ranked his
cousin Ajax, the son of Telamon, gigantic in size and of great
courage, but dull of intellect; Diomede, the son of Tydeus, second
only to Achilles in all the qualities of a hero; Ulysses, famous for
sagacity; and Nestor, the oldest of the Grecian chiefs, to whom
they all looked up for counsel.</p>

<p>But Troy was no feeble enemy. Priam the king, son of Laomedon
and brother of Tithonus and Hesione, was now old; but he
had been a wise prince and had strengthened his state by good
government at home and powerful alliances with his neighbors.
By his wife Hecuba he had a numerous family; but the principal
stay and support of his throne was his son Hector, one of the
noblest figures of antiquity. The latter had, from the first, a presentiment
of the ruin of Troy, but still he persevered in heroic resistance,
though he by no means justified the wrong which brought
this danger upon his country. He was united in marriage with
the noble Andromache, and as husband and father his character
was not less admirable than as warrior. The principal leaders on
the side of the Trojans, beside Hector, were his relative, &AElig;neas,
the son of Venus and Anchises, Deiphobus, Glaucus, and Sarpedon.</p>

<p><b>196. Iphigenia in Aulis.</b> After two years of preparation, the
Greek fleet and army assembled in the port of Aulis in B&oelig;otia.
Here Agamemnon, while hunting, killed a stag that was sacred to
Diana. The goddess in retribution visited the army with pestilence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
and produced a calm which prevented the ships from leaving the
port. Thereupon, Calchas the soothsayer announced that the wrath
of the virgin goddess
could only be appeased by
the sacrifice of a virgin,
and that none other but
the daughter of the offender
would be acceptable.
Agamemnon, however reluctant,
submitted to the
inevitable and sent for his
daughter Iphigenia, under
the pretense that her marriage
to Achilles was to be
at once performed. But,
in the moment of sacrifice,
Diana, relenting,
snatched the maiden away
and left a hind in her
place. Iphigenia, enveloped in a cloud, was conveyed to Tauris,
where Diana made her priestess of her temple.<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

<p><b>197. Protesila&uuml;s and Laodamia.</b> The wind now proving fair,
the fleet made sail and brought the forces to the coast of Troy.
The Trojans opposed their landing, and at the first onset one of
the noblest of the Greeks, Protesila&uuml;s, fell by the hand of Hector.
This Protesila&uuml;s had left at home his wife Laodamia (a niece of
Alcestis),&mdash;who was most tenderly attached to him. The story
runs that when the news of his death reached her, she implored
the gods for leave to converse with him if but for three hours.
The request was granted. Mercury led Protesila&uuml;s back to the
upper world; and when the hero died a second time Laodamia
died with him. It is said that the nymphs planted elm trees round
his grave, which flourished till they were high enough to command
a view of Troy, then withered away, giving place to fresh branches
that sprang from the roots.</p>

<p>Wordsworth has taken the story of Protesila&uuml;s and Laodamia
for a poem invested with the atmosphere of the classics. The
oracle, according to the tradition, had declared that victory should
be the lot of that party from which should fall the first victim in
the war. The poet represents Protesila&uuml;s, on his brief return to
earth, relating to Laodamia the story of his fate:</p>

<p><b>198. Homer's Iliad.</b> The war continued without decisive result
for nine years. Then an event occurred which seemed likely to
prove fatal to the cause of the Greeks,&mdash;a quarrel between Achilles
and Agamemnon. It is at this point that the great poem of Homer,
the Iliad, begins.</p>

<p>Of this and the other epics from which the story is drawn an
account will be found in Chapter XXXII below; and a list of
the best English translations, in the corresponding sections of the
Commentary. What delight one may derive from reading the
Greek epics even in translation is nowhere better expressed than
in the following sonnet of John Keats, "On First Looking into
Chapman's Homer":</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Much have I travel'd in the realms of gold,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Yet did I never breathe its pure serene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Then felt I like some watcher of the skies<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When a new planet swims into his ken;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes<br /></span>

<p><b>199. The Wrath of Achilles.</b> The Greeks, though unsuccessful
against Troy, had taken the neighboring and allied cities; and in
the division of the spoil a female captive, by name Chryse&iuml;s,
daughter of Chryses, priest of Apollo, had fallen to the share of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
Agamemnon. Chryses came bearing the sacred emblems of his
office and begged the release of his daughter. Agamemnon refused.
Thereupon Chryses implored Apollo to afflict the Greeks
till they should be forced to yield their prey. Apollo granted the
prayer of his priest and sent such pestilence upon the Grecian
camp, that a council was called to deliberate how to allay the wrath
of the gods and avert the plague. Achilles boldly charged the misfortunes
upon Agamemnon as caused by his withholding Chryse&iuml;s.
Agamemnon, in anger, consented, thereupon, to relinquish his
captive, but demanded that Achilles should yield to him in her
stead Brise&iuml;s, a maiden who had fallen to that hero's share in the
division of the spoil. Achilles submitted, but declared that he
would take no further part in the war,&mdash;withdrew his forces
from the general camp and avowed his intention of returning to
Greece.</p>

<p><b>200. The Enlistment of the Gods.</b> The gods and goddesses interested
themselves as much in this famous siege as did the parties
themselves. It was well known in heaven that fate had decreed
the fall of Troy, if her enemies only persevered. Yet there was
room for chance sufficient to excite by turns the hopes and fears
of the powers above who took part with either side. Juno and
Minerva, in consequence of the slight put upon their charms by
Paris, were hostile to the Trojans; Venus for the opposite cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
favored them; she enlisted, also, her admirer Mars on the same
side. Neptune favored the Greeks. Apollo was neutral, sometimes
taking one side, sometimes the other. Jove himself, though he
loved Priam, exercised a degree of impartiality,&mdash;not, however,
without exceptions.</p>

<p><b>201. Thetis intercedes for Achilles.</b> Resenting the injury done
by Agamemnon to her son, Thetis, the silver-footed, repaired to
Jove's palace, and besought him to grant success to the Trojan
arms and so make the Greeks repent of their injustice to Achilles.
The father of the gods, wavering at first, finally sighed and consented,
saying, "Go thou now, but look to it that Juno see thee
not, for oft she taunts me that I aid the Trojan cause." Vain
precaution: the jealous queen had seen only too well, and quickly
she confronted the Thunderer with her suspicions,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fateful favor to Achilles, hast thou granted now I trow!"<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><b>202. Agamemnon calls a Council.</b> In the events which immediately
follow we are introduced to the more important human personages
on both sides. To begin with, Agamemnon, king of men,
deceived by a dream sent by Jupiter, calls a council of the Greeks
in which, desiring to arouse them to fresh onslaught upon the
Trojans, he tests their patience first by depicting the joys of the
return home to Greece, and nearly overreaches himself in his cunning;
for had it not been for the wise Nestor, king of sandy Pylos,
and Ulysses of many devices, peer of Jove in wisdom, the common
soldiers, fired with hope of viewing their dear native land and
wives and little children once more, would have launched the ships
and sailed forthwith. Among the murmuring host of those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>clamor for retreat the leader is Thersites, uncontrolled of speech,
full of disorderly words, striving idly against the chieftains, aiming
ever to turn their authority into ridicule. He is the one ludicrous
character of the Iliad, this boaster and scandalmonger, sneering
and turbulent of tongue:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His figure such as might his soul proclaim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One eye was blinking, and one leg was lame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mountain shoulders half his breast o'erspread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thin hairs bestrewed his long misshapen head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spleen to mankind his envious heart possest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And much he hated all, but most the best.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses or Achilles still his theme;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But royal scandal his delight supreme.[1]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Him Ulysses hearing rebukes, raising his scepter to strike:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Peace, factious monster, born to vex the state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wrangling talents formed for foul debate....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have we not known thee, slave of all our host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man who acts the least, upbraids the most?..."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and cowering as the dastard bends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weighty scepter on his back descends:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the round bunch the bloody tumors rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tears spring starting from his haggard eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling he sat, and, shrunk in abject fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his wild visage wiped the scalding tears.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The revolt is thus stayed. A banquet of the Greek chieftains
is then held, merely of the greatest&mdash;Nestor, Idomeneus of Crete,
Ajax the son of Telamon and cousin of Achilles, and Ajax the less,
son of O&iuml;leus, Ulysses, also, and Agamemnon himself. Menela&uuml;s
comes, unbid but not unwelcome. Sacrifices are offered, but in
vain; Jove heeds them not. Finally, a muster of the Greek troops,
by nations and by kings, is determined upon; and so the army is
set in array.</p>

<p><b>203. Paris plays the Champion.</b> Likewise the army of the
Trojans; and battle is about to be joined when forth from the
Trojan ranks steps Paris himself to challenge some champion of
the opposing host to single combat,&mdash;the beauteous Paris,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In form a god! The panther's speckled hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowed o'er his armor with an easy pride,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bended bow across his shoulders flung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sword beside him negligently hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dared the bravest of the Grecian race.[1]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Him, Menela&uuml;s whom he had betrayed, Menela&uuml;s loved of Mars,
raging like a lion, swift espies and, leaping from his chariot,
hastens to encounter. But Paris, smitten with a sense of his own
treachery, fearful, trembling, pale at sight of the avenger, betakes
himself to his heels and hides in the thick of the forces behind.
Upbraided, however, by the generous Hector, noblest of Priam's
sons, the handsome Trojan recovers his self-possession and consents
to meet Menela&uuml;s in formal combat between the opposing
hosts: Helen and the wealth she brought to be the prize; and,
thus, the long war to reach its termination. The Greeks accept
the proposal, and a truce is agreed upon that sacrifices may be
made on either side for victory, and the duel proceed.</p>

<p><b>204. Helen surveys the Grecian Host.</b> Meantime, Iris, the goddess
of the rainbow, summons Helen to view the impending duel.
At her loom in the Trojan palace the ill-starred daughter of Leda
is sitting, weaving in a golden web her own sad story. At memory
of her former husband's love, her home, her parents, the princess
drops a tear; then, softly sighing, turns her footsteps to the
Sc&aelig;an gate. No word is said of her matchless beauty, but what it
was Homer shows us by its effect. For as she approaches the tower
where aged Priam and his gray-haired chieftains sit, these cry,&mdash;</p>

<p><b>205. Menela&uuml;s defeats Paris.</b> Now from both sides sacrifices
have been made to Jove, avenger of oaths, with prayer for victory
and vow of fidelity to the contract made. But Jove vouchsafes
not yet fulfillment. The lists are measured out by Hector and
Ulysses. The duel is on. Paris throws his spear: it strikes, but
fails to penetrate the shield of Menela&uuml;s. Menela&uuml;s then breaks
his blade upon the helmet of the Trojan, seizes him by the horsehair
crest, and drags him toward the Grecian lines. But Aphrodite
touches the chin strap of Paris' headpiece so that it breaks and
leaves the futile helmet in the victor's hand. Then, wrapping her
favorite in a mist, the goddess bears him from the pursuit of
the furious Menela&uuml;s, and, laying him safe in Helen's chamber,
summons his mistress, who first upbraids, then soothes him with
her love.</p>

<p>The Greeks claim the victory, and with justice. The Trojans,
then and there, would have yielded Helen and her wealth, and
the fate of Troy might have been averted, had it not been for the
machinations of the goddesses, Juno and Minerva. These could
not bear that the hated city should thus escape. Prompted by the
insidious urging of Minerva, one of the Trojans, Pandarus, breaks
the truce; he shoots his arrow full at the heart of the unsuspecting
Menela&uuml;s. Minerva, of course, deflects the fatal shaft. But
the treachery has accomplished its purpose; the war is reopened
with fresh bitterness.</p>

<p><b>206. The Two Days' Battle.</b> The battle which then begins lasts
for two whole days. In its progress we witness a series of single
combats. Pandarus the archer wounds Diomede, the son of Tydeus.
He in turn, raging over the plain, fells Pandarus with his spear
and crushes &AElig;neas, Priam's valiant kinsman, to his knees with a
great stone. Venus shrouds her fallen son in her shining veil
and will rescue him. But Diomedes, clear of vision, spies her out
and drives his pointed spear against her hand, grazing the palm
of it. Out leaps the ichor, life-stream of the blessed gods, and the
goddess shrieking drops her burden and flees from the jeering
Diomede;&mdash;nay, mounts even to Olympus where, sobbing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
arms of her mother, Dione, she finds solace of her pain, and
straightway turns to hopes of vengeance. &AElig;neas, meantime, is
wrapped by Ph&oelig;bus Apollo in a dusky cloud and borne aloft to
that god's temple, where Diana and Latona heal him.</p>

<p>To Diomede still breathing slaughter, the god of war himself,
Mars, now appears in form of a Thracian captain, opposing him
and stirring Hector and the swiftly recovered &AElig;neas and the godlike
Sarpedon against the Greeks. And the Greeks give back, but
the keen eye of Diomede pierces the disguise of the War-god,
and he shouts a warning to his comrades. Then Minerva descends
to where Diomede, the son of Tydeus, is resting beside
his chariot, and she spurs him afresh to the fray. "Thou joy of
my heart," says she, "fear thou neither Mars nor any other of the
immortals, for I shall help thee mightily." So she takes the place
of his charioteer, and together they drive upon the War-god. And
that one cannot come at the son of Tydeus to strike him down,
because of the ward that Minerva vouchsafes. But, for his part,
Diomede strikes his spear against the nethermost belly of Mars
and wounds him, rending his fair skin; and he plucks forth
the spear again. Then brazen Mars bellows loud as nine or ten
thousand soldiers all at once; and, like Venus before him, betakes
himself to Olympus. There, complaining to Jove, he receives
stern reprimand for his intolerant and hateful spirit, stirring men
ever to strife,&mdash;"like thine own mother Juno, after whom, not
after me, thou takest." Thus, the father of the gods; and he
makes an end, and bids P&aelig;an, the family physician, heal him.</p>

<p>Diomedes, still bearing down upon the Trojans, is about to fight
with a young warrior when, struck by his appearance, he inquires
his name. It is Glaucus, and the youth is grandson of the noble
Bellerophon. Then Diomede of the loud war cry is glad and strikes
his spear into the earth and declines to fight. "For lo," says he,
"our grandfathers were guest-friends, and guest-friends are we.
Why slay each other? There are multitudes of Trojans for me to
slay, and for thee Ach&aelig;ans in multitude, if thou canst. Let us
twain rather exchange arms as a testimony of our good faith."
And this they do; and Diomede gets the best of the bargain, his
armor being worth but nine oxen, and young Glaucus' five score.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p><b>207. Hector and Andromache.</b> The Trojans being still pushed
nearer to their own walls, Hector, bravest of Priam's sons, returns
to the city to urge the women to prayer, and to carry the loitering
Paris back with him to the defense. Here he meets his brave mother
Hecuba, and then the fair Helen; but most to our purpose and his,
his wife, the white-armed Andromache, the noblest of the women
of the Iliad, for whom he has searched in vain.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But when he had passed through the great city and was come to the Sc&aelig;an
gates, whereby he was minded to issue upon the plain, then came his dear-won
wife, running to meet him, even Andromache, daughter of great-hearted
E&euml;tion.... So she met him now; and with her went the handmaid bearing
in her bosom the tender boy, the little child, Hector's loved son, like unto a
beautiful star. Him Hector called Scamandrius, but all the folk Astyanax,
"defender of the city." So now he smiled and gazed at his boy silently, and
Andromache stood by his side weeping, and clasped her hand in his, and
spake and called upon his name. "Dear my lord, this thy hardihood will undo
thee, neither hast thou any pity for thine infant boy, nor for hapless me that
soon shall be thy widow; for soon will the Ach&aelig;ans all set upon thee and slay
thee. But it were better for me to go down to the grave if I lose thee; for
nevermore will any comfort be mine, when once thou, even thou, hast met thy
fate,&mdash;but only sorrow. Moreover I have no father, now, nor lady mother....
And the seven brothers that were mine within our halls, all these on the
selfsame day went within the house of Hades; for fleet-footed, goodly Achilles
slew them all amid their kine of trailing gait and white-faced sheep....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Nay, Hector, thou art to me father and lady mother, yea and brother, even
as thou art my goodly husband. Come now, have pity and abide here upon
the tower, lest thou make thy child an orphan and thy wife a widow." ...</p>

<p>Then great Hector of the glancing helm answered her: "Surely I take thought
for all these things, my wife; but I have very sore shame of the Trojans and
Trojan dames with trailing robes, if like a coward I shrink away from battle.
Moreover mine own soul forbiddeth me, seeing I have learnt ever to be valiant
and fight in the forefront of the Trojans, winning my father's great glory and
mine own. Yea of a surety, I know this in heart and soul; the day shall
come for holy Ilios to be laid low, and Priam and the folk of Priam of the
good ashen spear. Yet doth the anguish of the Trojans hereafter not so much
trouble me, neither Hecuba's own, neither king Priam's, neither my brethren's,
the many and brave that shall fall in the dust before their foemen, as doth
thine anguish in the day when some mail-clad Ach&aelig;an shall lead thee weeping,
and rob thee of the light of freedom.... But me in death may the heaped-up
earth be covering, ere I hear thy crying and thy carrying into captivity."<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p></div>

<p>So spoke the great-hearted hero, and stretched his arms out to
take his little boy. But</p>

<p>So prayed he, the glorious Hector, foreboding of the future, but
little thinking that, when he himself was slain and the city sacked,
his starlike son should be cast headlong to death from Troy's
high towers, and his dear wife led into captivity as he had
dreaded, indeed, and by none other than Neoptolemus, the son of
his mortal foe, Achilles. But now Hector laid the boy in the arms
of his wife, and she, smiling tearfully, gathered him to her fragrant
bosom; and her husband pitied her, and caressed her with his
hand, and bade her farewell, saying:</p>

</div></div>

<p>He took up his horsehair crested helmet; and she departed to
her home, oft looking back and letting fall big tears, thinking that
he would no more come back from battle.</p>

<p><b>208. Neptune aids the Discouraged Greeks.</b> But the end was
not to be so soon. Hector, returning to the field, challenged the
bravest of the Greeks to combat. Nine accepted the challenge;
but the lot fell upon Ajax, the son of Telamon. The duel lasted
till night, with deeds of valor on both sides; and the heroes parted,
each testifying to his foeman's worth. The next day a truce was
declared for the burning of the dead; but, soon after, the conflict
was renewed, and before the might of Hector and his troops the
Greeks were driven back to their trenches.</p>

<p>Then Agamemnon, king of men, called another council of his
wisest and bravest chiefs and, grievously discouraged, proposed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>this time in earnest, that they re&euml;mbark and sail home to Greece.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
In the debate that ensued Nestor advised that an embassy should
be sent to Achilles persuading him to return to the field; and that
Agamemnon should yield the maiden, the cause of dispute, with
ample gifts to atone for the wrong he had done. Agamemnon
assented; and Ulysses, Ajax, and Ph&oelig;nix were sent to carry to
Achilles the penitent message. They performed that duty, but
Achilles was deaf to their entreaties. He positively refused to
return to the attack and persisted in his determination to embark
for Greece without delay.</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Greeks, having constructed a rampart around
their ships, were now, instead of besieging Troy, in a manner
themselves besieged, within their rampart. The next day after the
unsuccessful embassy to Achilles, another battle was fought, in
which Agamemnon raged mightily with his spear till, wounded, he
was forced to retire to the hollow ships; and Ulysses, too, bravely
warring, had a narrow escape with life.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Then the Trojans, favored
by Jove, succeeded in forcing a passage through the Grecian rampart
and were about to set fire to the ships. But Neptune, seeing
the Greeks hard pressed, came to their rescue.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Appearing in the
form of Calchas the prophet, he raised the ardor of the warriors
to such a pitch that they forced the Trojans to give way. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>Ajax, son of Telamon, performed prodigies of valor. Bearing his
massy shield and "shaking his far-shadowing spear," he encountered
Hector.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The Greek shouted defiance, to which Hector
replied, and hurled his lance at the huge warrior. It was well
aimed and struck Ajax where the belts that bore his sword and
shield crossed each other on the breast, but the double guard prevented
its penetrating, and it fell harmless. Then Ajax, seizing a
huge stone, one of those that served to prop the ships, hurled it
at Hector. It struck him near the neck and stretched him on the
plain. His followers instantly seized him and bore him off stunned
and wounded.</p>

</div>

<p><b>209. Jupiter inspirits the Trojans.</b> While Neptune was thus
aiding the Greeks and driving back the Trojans, Jupiter saw
nothing of what was going on, for his attention had been drawn
from the field by the wiles of Juno.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> That goddess had arrayed
herself in all her charms, and to crown all had borrowed of Venus
her girdle, the Cestus, which enhanced the wearer's charms to
such a degree that they were irresistible. So prepared, Juno had
joined her husband, who sat on Olympus watching the battle.
When he beheld her, the fondness of his early love revived and,
forgetting the contending armies and all other affairs of state, he
gave himself up to her and let the battle go as it would.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>But this oblivion did not continue long. When, upon turning
his eyes downward, the cloud-compeller beheld Hector stretched,
almost lifeless, on the plain, he angrily dismissed Juno, commanding
her to send Iris and Apollo to him.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> The former bore a peremptory
message to Neptune, ordering him to quit the contest.
Apollo was dispatched to heal Hector's bruises and to inspirit his
heart. These orders were obeyed with such speed that while the
battle was still raging, Hector returned to the field and Neptune
betook himself to his own dominions.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 157. The Battle by the Ships</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><b>210. Achilles and Patroclus.</b> An arrow from the bow of Paris
had wounded Machaon, son of &AElig;sculapius, a brave warrior, who,
having inherited his father's art, was of great value to the Greeks
as their surgeon. Nestor, taking Machaon in his chariot, conveyed
him from the field. As they passed the ships of Achilles, that
hero, looking over the battle, saw the chariot of Nestor, and recognized
the old chief, but could not discern who the wounded warrior
was. Calling Patroclus, his companion and dearest friend, he
sent him to Nestor's tent to inquire. Patroclus, performing the
behest, saw Machaon wounded and, having told the cause of his
coming, would have hastened away, but Nestor detained him to
tell him the extent of the Grecian calamities. He reminded him
also how, at the time of the departure for Troy, Achilles and himself
had been charged by their respective sires: the one to aspire
to the highest pitch of glory; the other, as the elder, to keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>watch over his friend and to guide his inexperience. "Now,"
said Nestor, "is the time for such guidance. If the gods so please,
thou mayest win Achilles back to the common cause; but if not,
let him at least send his soldiers to the field, and come thou, Patroclus,
clad in his armor. Perhaps the very sight of it may drive
back the Trojans."<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<p><b>211. Patroclus in the Armor of Achilles.</b> Patroclus, strongly
moved by this address, hastened to his friend, revolving in his
mind what he had seen and heard.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> He told the prince the sad
condition of affairs at the camp of their late associates; Diomede,
Ulysses, Agamemnon, Machaon, all wounded, the rampart broken
down, the enemy among the ships preparing to burn them and
thus to cut off all means of return to Greece. While they spoke,
the flames burst forth from one of the ships. Achilles, at the sight,
relented so far as to intrust Patroclus with the Myrmidons for the
onslaught and to lend him his armor that he might thereby strike
the more terror into the minds of the Trojans. Without delay the
soldiers were marshaled, Patroclus put on the radiant armor,
mounted the chariot of Achilles, and led forth the men ardent for
battle. But before his friend went, Achilles strictly charged him
to be content with repelling the foe. "Seek not," said he, "to
press the Trojans without me, lest thou add still more to the disgrace
already mine." Then exhorting the troops to do their best,
he dismissed them full of ardor to the fight.</p>

<p>Patroclus and his Myrmidons at once plunged into the contest
where it raged hottest. At the sight of them the joyful Grecians
shouted, and the ships re&euml;choed the acclaim; but the Trojans,
beholding the well-known armor, struck with terror, looked everywhere
for refuge. First those who had got possession of the ship
and set it on fire allowed the Grecians to retake it and extinguish
the flames. Then the rest fled in dismay. Ajax, Menela&uuml;s, and
the two sons of Nestor performed prodigies of valor. Hector was
forced to turn his horses' heads and retire from the enclosure,
leaving his men encumbered in the fosse to escape as they could.
Patroclus drove all before him, slaying many; nor did one dare to
make a stand against him.</p>

</div>

<p><b>212. The Deaths of Sarpedon and Patroclus.</b> At last the grandson
of Bellerophon, Sarpedon, son of Jove and Laodamia, ventured
to oppose the Greek warrior. The Olympian looked down
upon his son and would have snatched him from the fate impending,
but Juno hinted that if he did so, the other inhabitants of
heaven might be induced to interpose in like manner whenever any
of their offspring were endangered,&mdash;an
argument to which
Jove yielded. Sarpedon threw
his spear, but missed Patroclus;
the spear of the Greek, on the
other hand, pierced Sarpedon's
breast, and he fell, calling to his
friends to save his body from
the foe. Then a furious contest
arose for the corpse. The
Greeks succeeded in stripping
Sarpedon of his armor, but
Jove would not suffer the body
to be dishonored. By his command
Apollo snatched it from
the midst of the combatants
and committed it to the care of
the twin brothers Death and
Sleep. By them it was transported
to Lycia, Sarpedon's
native land, and there received
due funeral rites.</p>

<p>Thus far Patroclus had succeeded to the utmost in repelling the
foe and relieving his countrymen, but now came a change of fortune.
Hector, borne in his chariot, confronted him. Patroclus
threw a vast stone at the Trojan, which missed its aim, but smote
Cebriones, the charioteer, and felled him from the car. Hector
leaped from the chariot to rescue his friend, and Patroclus also
descended to complete his victory. Thus the two heroes met face
to face. At this decisive moment the poet, as if reluctant to give
Hector the glory, records that Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, taking part against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Patroclus, struck the helmet from his head and the lance from his
hand. At the same moment an obscure Trojan wounded him in
the back, and Hector pressing forward pierced him with his spear.
He fell mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Then arose a tremendous conflict for the body of Patroclus; but
his armor was at once taken possession of by Hector, who, retiring
a short distance, divested himself of his own mail, put on that of
Achilles, then returned to the fight.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> Ajax and Menela&uuml;s defended
the body, and Hector and his bravest warriors struggled to capture
it. The battle still raged with equal fortune, when Jove enveloped
the whole face of heaven in a cloud. The lightning flashed, the
thunder roared, and Ajax, looking round for some one whom he
might dispatch to Achilles to tell him of the death of his friend
and of the imminent danger of his remains falling into the hands
of the enemy, could see no suitable messenger. In desperation
he exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Father of heaven and earth! deliver thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achaia's host from darkness; clear the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give day; and, since thy sovereign will is such,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destruction with it; but, oh, give us day!"<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Jupiter heard the prayer and dispersed the clouds. Ajax sent
Antilochus to Achilles with the intelligence of Patroclus' death
and of the conflict raging for his remains; and the Greeks at last
succeeded in bearing off the body to the ships, closely pursued by
Hector and &AElig;neas and the rest of the Trojans.</p>

<p><b>213. The Remorse of Achilles.</b> Achilles heard the fate of his
friend with such distress that Antilochus feared for a while lest he
might destroy himself.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> His groans reached the ears of Thetis,
far down in the deeps of ocean where she abode, and she hastened
to inquire the cause. She found him overwhelmed with self-reproach
that he had suffered his friend to fall a victim to his resentment.
His only consolation was the hope of revenge. He
would fly instantly in search of Hector. But his mother reminded
him that he was now without armor and promised, if he would
but wait till the morrow, to procure for him a suit of armor from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>Vulcan more than equal to that he had lost. He consented, and
Thetis immediately repaired to Vulcan's palace. She found him
busy at his forge, making tripods for his own use, so artfully constructed
that they moved forward of their own accord when wanted,
and retired again when dismissed. On hearing the request of
Thetis, Vulcan immediately laid aside his work and hastened to
comply with her wishes. He fabricated a splendid suit of armor
for Achilles; first a shield adorned with elaborate devices, of which
a noble description is given by Homer, then a helmet crested with
gold, then a corselet and greaves of impenetrable temper, all perfectly
adapted to the hero's form, and of consummate workmanship.
The suit was made in one night, and Thetis, receiving it,
descended to earth and laid it at Achilles' feet at the dawn of day.</p>

<p><b>214. The Reconciliation of Agamemnon and Achilles.</b> The first
glow of pleasure that Achilles had felt since the death of Patroclus
was at the sight of this splendid armor.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> And now arrayed
in it, he went forth to the camp, calling the chiefs to council.
When the leaders were assembled, Achilles addressed them. Renouncing
his displeasure against Agamemnon and bitterly lamenting
the miseries that had resulted from it, he called on them to
proceed at once to the field. Agamemnon made a suitable reply,
laying the blame on Ate, the goddess of infatuation; and thereupon
complete reconcilement took place between the heroes.</p>

<p>Then Achilles went forth to battle, heartened by the inspiration
of Minerva and filled with a rage and thirst for vengeance that
made him irresistible. As he mounted his chariot, one of his immortal
coursers was, strange to say, endowed suddenly with speech
from on high and, breaking into prophecy, warned the hero of his
approaching doom. But, nothing daunted, Achilles pressed upon
the foe. The bravest warriors fled before him or fell by his lance.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
Hector, cautioned by Apollo, kept aloof; but the god, assuming
the form of one of Priam's sons, Lycaon, urged &AElig;neas to encounter
the terrible warrior. &AElig;neas, though he felt himself unequal,
did not decline the combat. He hurled his spear with all
his force against the shield, the work of Vulcan. The spear pierced
two plates of the shield, but was stopped in the third. Achilles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>threw his spear with better success. It pierced through the shield
of &AElig;neas, but glanced near his shoulder and made no wound.
Then &AElig;neas, seizing a stone, such as two men of modern times
could hardly lift, was about to throw it,&mdash;and Achilles, with sword
drawn, was about to rush upon him,&mdash;when Neptune, looking out
upon the contest, had pity upon &AElig;neas, who was sure to have the
worst of it. The god, consequently, spread a cloud between the
combatants and, lifting the Trojan from the ground, bore him over
the heads of warriors and steeds to the rear of the battle. Achilles,
when the mist cleared away, looked round in vain for his adversary,
and acknowledging the prodigy, turned his arms against other
champions. But none dared stand before him; and Priam from
his city walls beheld the whole army in full flight toward the city.
He gave command to open wide the gates to receive the fugitives,
and to shut them as soon as the Trojans should have passed, lest
the enemy should enter likewise. But Achilles was so close in
pursuit that that would have been impossible if Apollo had not, in
the form of Agenor, Priam's son, first encountered the swift-footed
hero, then turned in flight, and taken the way apart from
the city. Achilles pursued, and had chased his supposed victim
far from the walls before the god disclosed himself.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p><b>215. The Death of Hector.</b> But when the rest had escaped into
the town Hector stood without, determined to await the combat.
His father called to him from the walls, begging him to retire nor
tempt the encounter. His mother, Hecuba, also besought him, but
all in vain. "How can I," said he to himself, "by whose command
the people went to this day's contest where so many have
fallen, seek refuge for myself from a single foe? Or shall I offer
to yield up Helen and all her treasures and ample of our own beside?
Ah no! even that is too late. He would not hear me
through, but slay me while I spoke." While he thus ruminated,
Achilles approached, terrible as Mars, his armor flashing lightning
as he moved. At that sight Hector's heart failed him and he fled.
Achilles swiftly pursued. They ran, still keeping near the walls,
till they had thrice encircled the city. As often as Hector approached
the walls Achilles intercepted him and forced him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>keep out in a wider circle. But
Apollo sustained Hector's strength
and would not let him sink in weariness.
Then Pallas, assuming the
form of Deiphobus, Hector's bravest
brother, appeared suddenly at his
side. Hector saw him with delight,
and thus strengthened, stopped his
flight, and, turning to meet Achilles,
threw his spear. It struck the shield
of Achilles and bounded back. He
turned to receive another from the
hand of Deiphobus, but Deiphobus
was gone. Then Hector understood
his doom and said, "Alas! it is plain
this is my hour to die! I thought
Deiphobus at hand, but Pallas deceived
me, and he is still in Troy.
But I will not fall inglorious." So
saying he drew his falchion from his
side and rushed at once to combat.
Achilles, secure behind his shield,
waited the approach of Hector.
When he came within reach of his
spear, Achilles, choosing with his eye
a vulnerable part where the armor
leaves the neck uncovered, aimed
his spear at that part, and Hector
fell, death-wounded. Feebly he said,
"Spare my body! Let my parents
ransom it, and let me receive funeral
rites from the sons and daughters
of Troy." To which Achilles replied,
"Dog, name not ransom nor pity to
me, on whom you have brought such
dire distress. No! trust me, nought
shall save thy carcass from the dogs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Though twenty ransoms and thy weight in gold were offered, I
should refuse it all."<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p><b>216. Achilles drags the Body of Hector.</b> So saying, the son of
Peleus stripped the body of its armor, and, fastening cords to the
feet, tied them behind his chariot, leaving the body to trail along
the ground. Then mounting the chariot he lashed the steeds and
so dragged the body to and fro before the city. No words can tell
the grief of Priam and Hecuba at this sight. His people could
scarce restrain the aged king from rushing forth. He threw himself
in the dust and besought them each by name to let him pass.
Hecuba's distress was not less violent. The citizens stood round
them weeping. The sound of the mourning reached the ears of
Andromache, the wife of Hector, as she sat among her maidens
at work; and anticipating evil she went forth to the wall. When
she saw the horror there presented, she would have thrown herself
headlong from the wall, but fainted and fell into the arms of
her maidens. Recovering, she bewailed her fate, picturing to
herself her country ruined, herself a captive, and her son, the
youthful Astyanax, dependent for his bread on the charity of
strangers.</p>

<span class="smcap">Tomb of Patroclus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>After Achilles and the Greeks had thus taken their revenge
on the slayer of Patroclus, they busied themselves in paying due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>funeral rites to their friend.<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> A pile was erected, and the body
burned with due solemnity. Then ensued games of strength and
skill, chariot races, wrestling, boxing, and archery. Later, the
chiefs sat down to the funeral banquet, and finally retired to rest.
But Achilles partook neither of the feast nor of sleep. The recollection
of his lost friend kept him awake,&mdash;the memory of their
companionship in toil and dangers, in battle or on the perilous
deep. Before the earliest dawn he left his tent, and joining to his
chariot his swift steeds, he fastened Hector's body to be dragged
behind. Twice he dragged him round the tomb of Patroclus, leaving
him at length stretched in the dust. But Apollo would not
permit the body to be torn or disfigured with all this abuse; he
preserved it free from taint or defilement.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

</div>

<p>While Achilles indulged his wrath in thus disgracing Hector,
Jupiter in pity summoned Thetis to his presence. Bidding her
prevail on Achilles to restore the body of Hector to the Trojans,
he sent Iris to encourage Priam to beg of Achilles the body of his
son. Iris delivered her message, and Priam prepared to obey.
He opened his treasuries and took out rich garments and cloths,
with ten talents in gold and two splendid tripods and a golden cup
of matchless workmanship. Then he called to his sons and bade
them draw forth his litter and place in it the various articles designed
for a ransom to Achilles. When all was ready, the old
king with a single companion as aged as himself, the herald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>Id&aelig;us, drove forth from the gates, parting there with Hecuba
his queen, and all his friends, who lamented him as going to
certain death.</p>

<p><b>217. Priam in the Tent of Achilles.</b><a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> But Jupiter, beholding
with compassion the venerable king, sent Mercury to be his guide
and protector. Assuming the form of a young warrior, Mercury
presented himself to the aged couple; and, when at the sight of
him they hesitated whether to fly or yield, approaching he grasped
Priam's hand and offered to be their guide to Achilles' tent. Priam
gladly accepted his service, and Mercury, mounting the carriage,
assumed the reins and conveyed them to the camp. Then having
cast the guards into a heavy sleep, he introduced Priam into the
tent where Achilles sat, attended by two of his warriors. The aged
king threw himself at the feet of Achilles and kissed those terrible
hands which had destroyed so many of his sons. "Think, O
Achilles," he said, "of thine own father, full of days like me, and
trembling on the gloomy verge of life. Even now, mayhap, some
neighbor chief oppresses him and there is none at hand to succor
him in his distress. Yet, knowing that Achilles lives, he doubtless
still rejoices, hoping that one day he shall see thy face again.
But me no comfort cheers, whose bravest sons, so late the flower of
Ilium, all have fallen. Yet one I had, one more than all the rest
the strength of my age, whom fighting for his country thou hast
slain. His body I come to redeem, bringing inestimable ransom
with me. Achilles! reverence the gods! recollect thy father! for
his sake show compassion to me!" These words moved Achilles,
and he wept, remembering by turns his absent father and his lost
friend. Moved with pity of Priam's silver locks and beard, he
raised him from the earth and spake: "Priam, I know that thou
hast reached this place conducted by some god, for without aid
divine no mortal even in his prime of youth had dared the attempt.
I grant thy request, for I am moved thereto by the manifest will
of Jove." So saying he arose, went forth with his two friends, and
unloaded of its charge the litter, leaving two mantles and a robe
for the covering of the body. This they placed on the litter and
spread the garments over it, that not unveiled it should be borne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>back to Troy. Then Achilles dismissed the old king, having first
pledged himself to a truce of twelve days for the funeral solemnities.</p>

<p>As the litter approached the city and was descried from the
walls, the people poured forth to gaze once more on the face of
their hero. Foremost of all, the mother and the wife of Hector
came, and at the sight of the lifeless body renewed their lamentations.
The people wept with them, and to the going down of the
sun there was no pause or abatement of their grief.</p>

<p>The next day, preparations were made for the funeral solemnities.
For nine days the people brought wood and built the pile;
and on the tenth they placed the body on the summit and applied
the torch, while all Troy, thronging forth, encompassed the pyre.
When it had completely burned, they quenched the cinders with
wine, and, collecting the bones, placed them in a golden urn, which
they buried in the earth. Over the spot they reared a pile of stones.</p>

</div>

<p><b>218. The Fall of Troy.</b> The story of the Iliad ends with the
death of Hector, and it is from the Odyssey and later poems that
we learn the fate of the other heroes. After the death of Hector,
Troy did not immediately fall, but receiving aid from new allies,
still continued its resistance. One of these allies was Memnon, the
Ethiopian prince, whose story
has been already told.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Another
was Penthesilea, queen
of the Amazons, who came
with a band of female warriors.
All the authorities attest the
valor of these women and the
fearful effect of their war cry.
Penthesilea, having slain many
of the bravest Greeks, was at
last slain by Achilles. But
when the hero bent over his
fallen foe and contemplated
her beauty, youth, and valor,
he bitterly regretted his victory. Thersites, the insolent brawler
and demagogue, attempting to ridicule his grief, was in consequence
slain by the hero.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p><b>219. The Death of Achilles.</b> But Achilles himself was not
destined to a long life. Having by chance seen Polyxena, daughter
of King Priam,&mdash;perhaps on occasion of the truce which was
allowed the Trojans for the burial of Hector,&mdash;he was captivated
with her charms; and to win her in marriage, it is said (but not
by Homer) that he agreed to influence the Greeks to make peace
with Troy. While the hero was in the temple of Apollo negotiating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>the marriage, Paris discharged at him a poisoned arrow,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> which,
guided by Apollo, fatally wounded him in the heel. This was his
only vulnerable spot; for Thetis, having dipped him when an infant
in the river Styx, had rendered every part of him invulnerable
except that by which she held him.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p>

<p><b>220. Contest for the Arms of Achilles.</b> The body of Achilles
so treacherously slain was rescued by Ajax and Ulysses. Thetis
directed the Greeks to bestow her son's armor on that hero who
of all survivors should be judged most deserving of it. Ajax and
Ulysses were the only claimants. A select number of the other
chiefs were appointed to award the prize. By the will of Minerva
it was awarded to Ulysses,&mdash;wisdom being thus rated above valor.
Ajax, enraged, set forth from his tent to wreak vengeance upon
the Atrid&aelig; and Ulysses. But the goddess robbed him of reason
and turned his hand against the flocks and herds of the Argives,
which he slaughtered or led captive to his tent, counting them the
rivals who had wronged him. Then the cruel goddess restored to
him his wits. And he, fixing his sword in the ground, prepared
to take his own life:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">"Come and look on me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Death, O Death,&mdash;and yet in yonder world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall dwell with thee, speak enough with thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thee I call, thou light of golden day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou Sun, who drivest on thy glorious car,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee, for this last time,&mdash;never more again!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All else, I speak in Hades to the dead."[3]<br /></span>

magnanimous foe, Ulysses, passed to the god that ruleth in gloom</p>

<p>It was now discovered that Troy could not be taken but by the
aid of the arrows of Hercules. They were in possession of Philoctetes,
the friend who had been with Hercules at the last and had
lighted his funeral pyre. Philoctetes<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> had joined the Grecian expedition
against Troy; but he accidentally wounded his foot with
one of the poisoned arrows, and the smell from the wound proved
so offensive that his companions carried him to the isle of Lemnos
and left him there. Diomede and Ulysses, or Ulysses and Neoptolemus
(son of Achilles), were now sent to induce him to rejoin
the army. They succeeded. Philoctetes was cured of his wound
by Machaon, and Paris was the first victim of the fatal arrows.</p>

<p><b>221. Paris and &OElig;none.</b> In his distress Paris bethought him of
one whom in his prosperity he had forgotten. This was the nymph
&OElig;none, whom he had married when a youth and had abandoned
for the fatal beauty of Helen. &OElig;none, remembering the wrongs
she had suffered, refused to heal the wound; and Paris went back
to Troy and died. &OElig;none quickly repented and hastened after him
with remedies, but came too late, and in her grief hanged herself.</p>

<p><b>222. The Palladium.</b> There was in Troy a celebrated statue
of Minerva called the Palladium. It was said to have fallen from
heaven, and the belief
was that the city could
not be taken so long
as this statue remained
within it. Ulysses and
Diomede entered the
city in disguise and succeeded
in obtaining the
Palladium, which they
carried off to the Grecian
camp.</p>

</div>

<p><b>223. The Wooden Horse.</b> But Troy still held out. The Greeks
began to despair of subduing it by force, and by
advice of Ulysses they resorted to stratagem.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> They pretended to
be making preparations to abandon the siege; and a number of the
ships were withdrawn and concealed behind a neighboring island.
They then constructed an immense wooden horse, which they gave
out was intended as a propitiatory offering to Minerva; but it was,
in fact, filled with armed men. The rest of the Greeks then betook
themselves to their ships and sailed away, as if for a final departure.
The Trojans, seeing the encampment broken up and the fleet
gone, concluded that the enemy had abandoned the siege. The
gates of the city were thrown open, and the whole population issued
forth, rejoicing at the long-prohibited liberty of passing freely over
the scene of the late encampment. The great horse was the chief
object of curiosity. Some recommended that it be taken into the
city as a trophy; others felt afraid of it. While they hesitated,
Laoco&ouml;n, the priest of Neptune, exclaimed, "What madness, citizens,
is this! Have you not learned enough of Grecian fraud to
be on your guard against it? For my part, I fear the Greeks even
when they offer gifts."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> So saying, he threw his lance at the
horse's side. It struck, and a hollow sound reverberated like a
groan. Then perhaps the people might have taken his advice and
destroyed the fatal horse with its contents, but just at that moment
a group of people appeared dragging forward one who seemed a
prisoner and a Greek. Stupefied with terror, the captive was
brought before the chiefs. He informed them that he was a Greek,
Sinon by name; and that in consequence of the malice of Ulysses,
he had been left behind by his countrymen at their departure.
With regard to the wooden horse, he told them that it was a propitiatory
offering to Minerva, and had been made so huge for the
express purpose of preventing its being carried within the city;
for Calchas the prophet had told them that if the Trojans took
possession of it, they would assuredly triumph over the Greeks.</p>

<p><b>224. Laoco&ouml;n and the Serpents.</b> This language turned the tide
of the people's feelings, and they began to think how they might
best secure the monstrous horse and the favorable auguries connected
with it, when suddenly a prodigy occurred which left no
room for doubt. There appeared advancing over the sea two immense
serpents. They came upon the land and the crowd fled in
all directions. The serpents advanced directly to the spot where
Laoco&ouml;n stood with his two sons. They first attacked the children,
winding round their bodies and breathing pestilential breath in
their faces. The father, attempting to rescue them, was next
seized and involved in the serpent's coils.</p>

<p>He struggled to tear them away, but they overpowered all his
efforts and strangled him and the children in their poisonous folds.
The event was regarded as a clear indication of the displeasure of
the gods at Laoco&ouml;n's irreverent treatment of the wooden horse,
which they no longer hesitated to regard as a sacred object and
prepared to introduce with due solemnity into the city. They did
so with songs and triumphal acclamations, and the day closed with
festivity. In the night the armed men who were inclosed in the
body of the horse, being let out by the traitor Sinon, opened the
gates of the city to their friends who had returned under cover of
the night. The city was set on fire; the people, overcome with feasting
and sleep, were put to the sword, and Troy completely subdued.</p>

hurled his spear with feeble hand against Pyrrhus and was

were carried captives to Greece. Cassandra had been loved
by Apollo, who gave her the gift of prophecy; but afterwards offended
with her, he had rendered the gift unavailing by ordaining
that her predictions should never be believed. Polyxena, another
daughter, who had been loved by Achilles, was demanded by the
ghost of that warrior and was sacrificed by the Greeks upon his
tomb. Of the fate of the white-armed Andromache we have already
spoken. She was carried off as the wife of Neoptolemus, but he
was faithful to her for only a short time. After he had cast her
aside she married Helenus, a brother of Hector, and still later
returned to Asia Minor.</p>

<p><b>227. Helen, Menela&uuml;s, and Agamemnon.</b> On the fall of Troy,
Menela&uuml;s recovered possession of his wife, who, it seems, had not
ceased to love him, though she had yielded to the might of Venus
and deserted him for another.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> After the death of Paris, she aided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>the Greeks secretly on several occasions: in particular when Ulysses
and Diomede entered the city in disguise to carry off the Palladium.
She then saw and recognized Ulysses, but kept the secret
and even assisted them in obtaining the image. Thus she became
reconciled to Menela&uuml;s, and they were among the first to leave the
shores of Troy for their native land. But having incurred the displeasure
of the gods, they were driven by storms from shore to
shore of the Mediterranean, visiting Cyprus, Ph&oelig;nicia, and Egypt.
In Egypt they were kindly treated and presented with rich gifts, of
which Helen's share was a golden spindle and a basket on wheels.</p>

</div></div>

<p>At last, arriving in safety at Sparta, Menela&uuml;s and Helen resumed
their royal dignity, and lived and reigned in splendor; and
when Telemachus, the son of Ulysses, in search of his father,
arrived at Sparta, he found them celebrating the marriage of their
daughter Hermione to Neoptolemus, son of Achilles.</p>

<p>Agamemnon<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> was not so fortunate in the issue. During his
absence his wife Clytemnestra had been false to him; and when
his return was expected, she with her paramour, &AElig;gisthus, son of
Thyestes, laid a plan for his destruction. Cassandra warned the
king, but as usual her prophecy was not regarded. While Agamemnon
was bathing previous to the banquet given to celebrate
his return, the conspirators murdered him.</p>

</div>

<p><b>228. Electra and Orestes.</b> It was the intention of the conspirators
to slay his son Orestes also, a lad not yet old enough to be an
object of apprehension, but from whom, if he should be suffered to
grow up, there might be danger. Electra, the sister of Orestes, saved
her brother's life by sending him secretly to his uncle Strophius,
king of Phocis. In the palace of Strophius, Orestes grew up with
the king's son Pylades, and formed with him a friendship which
has become proverbial.
Electra frequently reminded
her brother
by messengers of the
duty of avenging his
father's death; he, too,
when he reached maturity,
consulted the
oracle of Delphi, which
confirmed him in the
design. He therefore
repaired in disguise to
Argos, pretending to
be a messenger from
Strophius, who would
announce the death of
Orestes. He brought
with him what purported
to be the ashes
of the deceased in a
funeral urn. After visiting
his father's tomb and sacrificing upon it, according to the rites
of the ancients, he met by the way his sister Electra. Mistaking her
for one of the domestics, and desirous of keeping his arrival a secret
till the hour of vengeance should arrive, he produced the urn. At
once his sister, believing Orestes to be really dead, took the urn from
him, and, embracing it, poured forth her grief in language full of tenderness
and despair. Soon a recognition was effected, and the prince,
with the aid of his sister, slew both &AElig;gisthus and Clytemnestra.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

slaughter of a mother by her son, though extenuated by the guilt
of the victim and the express command of the gods, did not fail
to awaken in the breasts of
the ancients the same abhorrence
that it does in ours. The
Eumenides seized upon Orestes
and drove him frantic from land
to land. In these wanderings
Pylades accompanied him and
watched over him. At length in
answer to a second appeal to the
oracle, Orestes was directed to
go to the temple of the Tauri in Scythia and to bring thence a statue
of Diana which was believed to have fallen from heaven. Accordingly
the friends went to the Tauric Chersonese. Since there the
barbarous people were
accustomed to sacrifice
to the goddess all
strangers who fell into
their hands, the two
friends were seized
and carried bound to
the temple to be
made victims. But
the priestess of Diana
of the Tauri was no
other than Iphigenia,
the sister of Orestes,
who had been snatched
away by Diana at the
moment when she was
about to be sacrificed.
Ascertaining from the prisoners who they were, Iphigenia disclosed
herself to them; and the three made their escape with the statue
of the goddess, and returned to Mycen&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p><b>230. His Purification.</b> But Orestes was not yet relieved from
the vengeance of the Erinyes. Finally, he took refuge with
Minerva at Athens. The goddess afforded him protection and
appointed the court of Areopagus to decide his fate. The Erinyes
brought their accusation, and Orestes pleaded the command
of the Delphic oracle as his excuse. When the court voted and
the voices were equally divided, Orestes was acquitted by the command
of Minerva. He was then purified with plentiful blood
of swine.</p>

<p><b>232. The Lotus-eaters.</b> Sailing thence they were overtaken
by a storm which drove them for nine days till they reached the
country of the Lotos-eaters. Here, after watering, Ulysses sent
three of his men to discover who the inhabitants were. These
men on coming among the Lotos-eaters were kindly entertained
by them and were given some of their own food, the lotos plant,
to eat. The effect of this food was such that those who partook
of it lost all thought of home and wished to remain in that country.
It was by main force that Ulysses dragged these men away, and he
was even obliged to tie them under the benches of his ship.</p>

<p><b>233. The Cyclopes.</b> They next arrived at the country of the
Cyclopes. The Cyclopes<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> inhabited an island of which they were
the only possessors. They dwelt in caves and fed on the wild productions
of the island and on what their flocks yielded, for they
were shepherds. Ulysses left the main body of his ships at anchor,
and with one vessel went to the Cyclopes' island to explore for
supplies. He landed with his companions, carrying with them a
jar of wine for a present. Coming to a large cave they entered it,
and, finding no one within, examined its contents. They found it
stored with the riches of the flock, quantities of cheese, pails and
bowls of milk, lambs and kids in their pens, all in good order.
Presently arrived the master of the cave, Polyphemus, bearing an
immense bundle of firewood, which he threw down before the
cavern's mouth. He then drove into the cave the sheep and goats
to be milked, and, entering, rolled to the cave's mouth an enormous
rock, that twenty oxen could not draw. Next he sat down
and milked his ewes, preparing a part for cheese and setting the
rest aside for his customary drink. Then turning round his one
huge eye he discerned the strangers, and growled out at them, demanding
who they were and where from. Ulysses replied most
humbly, stating that they were Greeks from the great expedition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>that had lately won so much glory in the conquest of Troy, that
they were now on their way home, and finished by imploring his
hospitality in the name of the gods. Polyphemus deigned no
answer, but reaching out his hand seized two of the men, whom
he hurled against the side of the cave and dashed out their brains.
He proceeded to devour them with great relish, and having made
a hearty meal, stretched himself on the floor to sleep. Ulysses
was tempted to seize the opportunity and plunge his sword into
him as he slept, but recollected that it would only expose them all
to certain destruction, as the rock with which the giant had closed
up the door was far beyond their power to remove, and they would
therefore be in hopeless imprisonment.</p>

<p>Next morning the giant seized two more of the men and dispatched
them in the same manner as their companions, feasting
on their flesh till no fragment was left. He then moved away the
rock from the door, drove out his flocks, and went out, carefully replacing
the barrier after him. When he was gone Ulysses planned
how he might take vengeance for his murdered friends and effect
his escape with his surviving companions. He made his men prepare
a massive bar of wood cut by the Cyclops for a staff, which
they found in the cave. They sharpened the end of the staff and
seasoned it in the fire, and hid it under the straw on the cavern
floor. Then four of the boldest were selected, with whom Ulysses
joined himself as a fifth. The Cyclops came home at evening,
rolled away the stone, and drove in his flock as usual. After
milking them and making his arrangements as before, he seized
two more of Ulysses' companions, dashed their brains out, and
made his evening meal upon them as he had on the others. After
he had supped, Ulysses approaching him handed him a bowl of
wine, saying, "Cyclops, this is wine; taste and drink after thy
meal of man's flesh." He took and drank it, and was hugely
delighted with it, and called for more. Ulysses supplied him once
and again, which pleased the giant so much that he promised him
as a favor that he should be the last of the party devoured. He
asked his name, to which Ulysses replied, "My name is Noman."</p>

<p>After his supper the giant sought his repose, and was soon
sound asleep. Then Ulysses with his four select friends held the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
end of the stake in the fire till it was one burning coal, then poising
it exactly above the giant's only eye, they plunged it deep into
the socket, twirling it round as a carpenter does his auger. The
howling monster with his outcry filled the cavern, and Ulysses
with his aids nimbly got out of his way and concealed themselves
in the cave. He, bellowing, called aloud on all the Cyclopes
dwelling in the caves around him, far and near. They, on his cry,
flocked round the den, and inquired what grievous hurt had caused
him to sound such an alarm and break their slumbers. He replied,
"O friends, I die, and Noman gives the blow." They answered,
"If no man hurts thee, it is the stroke of Jove, and thou must
bear it." So saying, they left him groaning.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 171. Boring out the Cyclops' Eye</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>Next morning the Cyclops rolled away the stone to let his flock
out to pasture, but planted himself in the door of the cave to feel
of all as they went out, that Ulysses and his men should not escape
with them. But Ulysses had made his men harness the rams
of the flock three abreast, with osiers which they found on the
floor of the cave. To the middle ram of the three one of the
Greeks suspended himself, so protected by the exterior rams on
either side. As they passed, the giant felt of the animals' backs
and sides, but never thought of their bellies; so the men all passed
safe, Ulysses himself being on the last one that passed. When
they had got a few paces from the cavern, Ulysses and his friends
released themselves from their rams and drove a good part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
flock down to the shore to their boat. They put them aboard with
all haste, then pushed off from the shore; and when at a safe distance
Ulysses shouted out, "Cyclops, the gods have well requited
thee for thy atrocious deeds. Know it is Ulysses to whom thou
owest thy shameful loss of sight." The Cyclops, hearing this,
seized a rock that projected from the side of the mountain, and
rending it from its bed,
he lifted it high in the
air, then exerting all
his force, hurled it in
the direction of the
voice. Down came the
mass, just forward of
the vessel. The ocean,
at the plunge of the
huge rock, heaved the
ship toward Polyphemus; but a second rock which he hurled,
striking aft, propelled them fortunately in the direction that they
desired to take. Ulysses was about to hail the giant again, but his
friends besought him not to do so. He could not forbear, however,
letting the giant know that they had escaped his missile,
but waited till they had reached a safer distance than before.
The giant answered them with curses, while Ulysses and his
friends, plying their oars vigorously, regained their companions.</p>

<p><b>234. The Bag of Winds.</b> Ulysses next arrived at the island of
&AElig;olus.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> He treated Ulysses hospitably, and at his departure gave
him, tied up in a leathern bag with a silver string, such winds as
might be hurtful and dangerous, commanding fair winds to blow
the barks toward their country. Nine days they sped before the
wind, and all that time Ulysses had stood at the helm without
sleep. At last quite exhausted he lay down to sleep. While
he slept, the crew conferred together about the mysterious bag,
and concluded it must contain treasures given by the hospitable
King &AElig;olus to their commander. Tempted to secure some portion
for themselves, they loosed the string, when immediately
the winds rushed forth. The ships were driven far from their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>course and back again to the island they had just left. &AElig;olus,
indignant at their folly, refused to assist them further, and they
were obliged to labor over their course once more by means of
their oars.</p>

<p><b>235. The L&aelig;strygonians.</b> Their next adventure was with the
barbarous tribe of L&aelig;strygonians. The vessels all pushed into the
harbor, tempted by the secure appearance of the cove, completely
landlocked; only Ulysses moored his vessel without. As soon as
the L&aelig;strygonians found the ships completely in their power, they
attacked them, heaving huge stones which broke and overturned
them, while with their spears they dispatched the seamen as they
struggled in the water. All the vessels with their crews were
destroyed, except Ulysses' own ship which had remained outside.
He, finding no safety but in flight, exhorted his men to ply their
oars vigorously; and they escaped.</p>

<p><b>236. The Isle of &AElig;&aelig;a.</b> With grief for their slain companions
mixed with joy at their own escape, they pursued their way till they
arrived at the &AElig;&aelig;an isle, where Circe dwelt, the daughter of the
sun. Landing here, Ulysses climbed a hill and, gazing round, saw
no signs of habitation except in one spot at the center of the
island, where he perceived a palace embowered with trees. He sent
forward one half of his crew, under the command of Eurylochus,
to see what prospect of hospitality they might find. As they approached
the palace, they found themselves surrounded by lions,
tigers, and wolves, not fierce, but tamed by Circe's art, for she was
a powerful magician. These animals had once been men, but had
been changed by Circe's enchantments into the forms of beasts.
The sounds of soft music were heard from within, and a sweet
female voice singing. Eurylochus called aloud, and the goddess
came forth and invited them in; they all gladly entered except
Eurylochus, who suspected danger. The goddess conducted her
guests to a seat, and had them served with wine and other delicacies.
When they had feasted heartily, she touched them one by
one with her wand, and they became immediately changed into
swine, in "head, body, voice, and bristles," yet with their intellects
as before. She shut them in her styes and supplied them
with acorns and such other things as swine love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>Eurylochus hurried back to the ship and told the tale. Ulysses
thereupon determined to go himself and try if by any means he
might deliver his companions. As he strode onward alone, he met
a youth who addressed him familiarly, appearing to be acquainted
with his adventures. He announced himself as Mercury, and informed
Ulysses of the arts of Circe and of the danger of approaching
her. As Ulysses was not to be dissuaded from his attempt,
Mercury provided him with a sprig of the plant Moly, of wonderful
power to resist sorceries, and instructed him how to act.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the companions of Ulysses made mournful plaint to
their cruel mistress:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">They rose about her, striving each o'er each,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With restless, fierce importuning that yearned<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through those brute masks some piteous tale to teach,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Ulysses, reaching the palace, was courteously received by Circe,
who entertained him as she had done his companions, but after
he had eaten and drunk, touched him with her wand, saying,
"Hence, seek the stye and wallow with thy friends." But he, instead
of obeying, drew his sword and rushed upon her with fury
in his countenance. She fell on her knees and begged for mercy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>
<p>He dictated a solemn oath that she would release his companions
and practice no further harm against him or them; and she repeated
it, at the same time promising to dismiss them all in safety
after hospitably entertaining them. She was as good as her word.
The men were restored to their shapes, the rest of the crew summoned
from the shore, and all magnificently entertained day after
day, till Ulysses seemed to have forgotten his native land and to
have reconciled himself to an inglorious life of ease and pleasure.</p>

<p><b>237. Ulysses visits Hades.</b> At length his companions recalled
him to nobler sentiments, and he received their admonition gratefully.
Circe, won over by his prayers, consented to send him on
his homeward way. But she warned him that first he must perform
another journey, must visit the Underworld and there learn from
the shade of Tiresias, the blind prophet of Thebes, the way and
measure of his path, and how to proceed to Ithaca over the
teeming deep.</p>

<p>"But who will guide us?" queried Ulysses in amaze; "for no
man ever yet sailed to hell in a black ship."</p>

<p>"Son of La&euml;rtes," replied the Goddess, "Ulysses of many devices,
nay, trouble not thyself for want of a guide, by thy ship
abiding, but set up the mast and spread abroad the white sails and
sit thee down; and the breeze of the North Wind will bear thy
vessel on her way. But when thou hast now sailed in thy ship
across the stream Oceanus where is a waste shore and the groves
of Persephone, even tall poplar trees and willows that shed their
fruit before the season, there beach thy ship by deep-eddying
Oceanus, but go thyself to the dank house of Hades. Thereby
into Acheron flows Pyriphlegethon, and Cocytus, a branch of the
water of the Styx; and there is a rock, and the meeting of the
two roaring waters. There dig a trench and pour a drink offering
to all the dead, mead and sweet wine and water, sprinkling white
meal thereon. And when thou hast prayed to them, offer up a ram
and a black ewe. Then will many spirits come to thee of the dead
that be departed; but thou shalt draw thy sharp sword and suffer
them not to approach the blood, ere thou hast word of Tiresias."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span></p>
<p>So Ulysses and his companions did as they were bid. And the
ship came to the limits of the world, to the deep-flowing Oceanus.
There is the land and city of the Cimmerians, where no ray of
sunshine ever falls, but deadly night is outspread over miserable
mortals. And there Ulysses and those with him performed the
drink offering and the prayer and the sacrifice; and Ulysses fended
off the spirits of the dead from the blood until the soul of the
Theban prophet arrived. And that one, having drunk of the dark
blood, declared unto Ulysses the future of his way: how the Earthshaker,
god of the waters, should oppose him, but how he should
win home without further disaster if, when passing the isle Thrinacia,
he would but restrain the spirit of his men so that they
should do no injury to the cattle of the Sun grazing thereon. If,
however, these cattle were not respected but hurt, then there should
follow ruin for both ship and men; and Ulysses himself on the
ship of strangers should return late in time to his home, to find
sorrows there, proud men wasting his patrimony and wooing his
godlike wife to wed her. But that he should avenge their violence,
and settle his affairs at home, and then betake himself again to
wandering; and that from the sea should his own death come,&mdash;"the
gentlest death that may be, which shall end thee fordone
with smooth old age; and the folk shall dwell happily around thee."</p>

<p>In the land of Hades, Ulysses saw also the shade of his mother,
and spoke with her of his father and of Penelope, his wife, and of
his son Telemachus. And he saw also the shades of Antiope and
Alcmene and Ph&aelig;dra and Procris; and of Agamemnon, and
Achilles, and Ajax, the son of Telamon, and of many others,
and spoke with them of their own fates and of the affairs of the
upper world.</p>

<p><b>238. The Sirens.</b> Returning from the abode of the shades,
Ulysses revisited the &AElig;&aelig;an isle and recounted to Circe his adventures
and the wondrous visions and the laws of Hell. She in return
speeded his homeward voyage, instructing him particularly
how to pass safely by the coast of the Sirens.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>These nymphs had the power, as has been already said, of
charming by their song all who heard them, so that mariners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>were impelled to cast themselves into the sea to destruction. Circe
directed Ulysses to stop the ears of his seamen with wax, so that
they should not hear the strain; to have himself bound to the
mast, and to enjoin his people, whatever he might say or do, by
no means to release him till they should have passed the Sirens'
island. Ulysses obeyed these directions. As they approached the
Sirens' island, the sea was calm, and over the waters came notes
of music so ravishing and attractive that Ulysses struggled to get
loose and, by cries and
signs to his people,
begged to be released;
but they, obedient to his
previous orders, sprang
forward and bound
him still faster. They
held on their course,
and the music grew
fainter till it ceased to
be heard, when with
joy Ulysses gave his
companions the signal
to unseal their ears;
and they relieved him from his bonds. It is said that one of the
Sirens, Parthenope, in grief at the escape of Ulysses drowned herself.
Her body was cast up on the Italian shore where now stands
the city of Naples, in early times called by the Siren's name.</p>

</div>

<p><b>239. Scylla and Charybdis.</b> Ulysses had been warned by Circe
of the two monsters Scylla and Charybdis. We have already met
with Scylla in the myth of Glaucus. She dwelt in a cave high up
on the cliff, from whence she was accustomed to thrust forth her
long necks (for she had six heads), and in each of her mouths to
seize one of the crew of every vessel passing within reach. The
other terror, Charybdis, was a gulf nearly on a level with the
water. Thrice each day the water rushed into a frightful chasm,
and thrice was disgorged. Any vessel coming near the whirlpool
when the tide was rushing in must inevitably be engulfed; not
Neptune himself could save it. On approaching the haunt of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
dread monsters, Ulysses kept strict watch to discover them. The
roar of the waters as Charybdis engulfed them gave warning at
a distance, but Scylla could nowhere be discerned. While Ulysses
and his men watched with anxious
eyes the dreadful whirlpool,
they were not equally on
their guard from the attack
of Scylla,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> and the monster,
darting forth her snaky heads,
caught six of his men and bore
them away shrieking to her
den. Ulysses was unable to
afford any assistance.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 175. Ulysses and Scylla</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><b>240. The Cattle of the Sun.</b>
Both Tiresias and Circe had
warned him of another danger.
After passing Scylla and Charybdis the next land he would make
was Thrinacia, an island whereon were pastured the cattle of
Helios, the Sun, tended by his daughters Lampetia and Pha&euml;thusa.
These flocks must not be violated, whatever the wants of the voyagers
might be. If this injunction were transgressed, destruction
was sure to fall on the offenders. Ulysses would willingly have
passed the island of the Sun without stopping, but his companions
so urgently pleaded for the rest and refreshment that would be
derived from anchoring and passing the night on shore, that
Ulysses yielded. He made them swear, however, not to touch the
sacred flocks and herds, but to content themselves with what provision
they yet had left of the supply which Circe had put on
board. So long as this supply lasted the people kept their oath;
but contrary winds detained them at the island for a month, and
after consuming all their stock of provisions, they were forced to
rely upon the birds and fishes they could catch. Famine pressed
them, and at last, in the absence of Ulysses, they slew some of the
cattle, vainly attempting to make amends for the deed by offering
from them a portion to the offended powers. Ulysses, on his
return to the shore, was horror-struck at perceiving what they had
done, and the more so on account of the portentous signs which
followed. The skins crept on the ground, and the joints of meat
lowed on the spits while roasting.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>The wind becoming fair, they sailed from the island. They had
not gone far when the weather changed, and a storm of thunder
and lightning ensued. A stroke of lightning shattered their mast,
which in its fall killed the pilot. At last the vessel itself went to
pieces. The keel and mast floating side by side, Ulysses formed of
them a raft to which he clung; and, the wind changing, the waves
bore him to Calypso's island. All the rest of the crew perished.</p>

<p><b>241. Calypso's Island.</b> Calypso, a sea-nymph, received Ulysses
hospitably, entertained him magnificently, became enamored of
him, and wished to retain him forever, offering him immortality.
He remained with her seven long years. But he persisted
in his resolution to return to his country and his wife and son.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
Calypso at last received the command of Jove to dismiss him.
Mercury brought the message to her and found her in her grotto.</p>

<p>Calypso, with much reluctance, proceeded to obey the commands
of Jupiter. She supplied Ulysses with the means of constructing
a raft, provisioned it well for him, and gave him a favoring gale.
He sped on his course prosperously for many days, till at last,
when in sight of land, a storm arose that broke his mast and
threatened to rend the raft asunder. In this crisis he was seen
by a compassionate sea-nymph, Leucothea, who, in the form of a
cormorant, alighted on the raft and presented him with a girdle,
directing him to bind it beneath his breast, that, if he should be
compelled to trust himself to the waves, it might buoy him up and
enable him to reach the land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p><b>242. The Land of the Ph&aelig;acians.</b> Ulysses clung to the raft so
long as its timbers held together, and when it no longer yielded
him support, binding the girdle around him, he swam. Minerva
smoothed the billows before him and sent him a wind that rolled
the waves towards the shore. The surf beat high on the rocks
and seemed to forbid approach; but at length finding calm water
at the mouth of a gentle stream, he landed, spent with toil, breathless
and speechless and almost dead. Reviving after some time,
he kissed the soil, rejoicing, yet at a loss what course to take. At
a short distance he perceived a wood, to which he turned his steps.
There finding a covert sheltered by intermingling branches alike
from the sun and the rain, he collected a pile of leaves and formed
a bed, on which he stretched himself, and, heaping the leaves over
him, fell asleep.</p>

<p>The land where he was thrown was Scheria, the country of the
Ph&aelig;acians.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> These people dwelt originally near the Cyclopes;
but, being oppressed by that savage race, they migrated to the isle
of Scheria under the conduct of Nausitho&uuml;s, their king. They were,
the poet tells us, a people akin to the gods, who appeared manifestly
and feasted among them when they offered sacrifices, and
did not conceal themselves from solitary wayfarers when they met
them. They had abundance of wealth and lived in the enjoyment
of it undisturbed by the alarms of war; for as they dwelt remote
from gain-seeking man, no enemy ever approached their shores,
and they did not even require to make use of bows and quivers.
Their chief employment was navigation. Their ships, which went
with the velocity of birds, were endued with intelligence; they
knew every port and needed no pilot. Alcino&uuml;s, the son of Nausitho&uuml;s,
was now their king, a wise and just sovereign, beloved by
his people.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the very night on which Ulysses was cast
ashore on the Ph&aelig;acian island, and while he lay sleeping on his
bed of leaves, Nausicaa, the daughter of the king, had a dream
sent by Minerva, reminding her that her wedding day might not
be far distant, and that it would be but a prudent preparation for
that event to have a general washing of the clothes of the family.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>
<p>This was no slight affair, for the fountains were at some distance
and the garments must be carried thither. On awaking, the princess
hastened to her parents to tell them what was on her mind,&mdash;not
alluding to her wedding day, but finding other reasons equally
good. Her father readily assented and ordered the grooms to
furnish forth a wagon for the purpose. The clothes were put
therein, and the queen, her mother, placed in the wagon likewise
an abundant supply of food and wine. The princess took her seat
and plied the lash, her attendant virgins following her on foot.
Arrived at the riverside they turned out the mules to graze, and
unlading the carriage, bore the garments down to the water, and,
working with cheerfulness and alacrity, soon dispatched their labor.
Then having spread the garments on the shore to dry, and having
themselves bathed, they sat down to enjoy their meal; after which
they rose and amused themselves with a game of ball, the princess
singing to them while they played. But when they had
refolded the apparel and were about to resume their way to the
town, Minerva caused the ball thrown by the princess to fall into
the water, whereat they all screamed, and Ulysses awaked at the
sound.</p>

<p>Utterly destitute of clothing, he discovered that only a few bushes
were interposed between him and a group of young maidens, whom,
by their deportment and attire, he discovered to be not mere peasant
girls, but of a higher class. Breaking off a leafy branch from
a tree, he held it before him and stepped out from the thicket. The
virgins at sight of him fled in all directions, Nausicaa alone excepted,
for her Minerva aided and endowed with courage and discernment.
Ulysses, standing respectfully aloof, told his sad case,
and besought the fair object (whether queen or goddess he professed
he knew not) for food and clothing. The princess replied
courteously, promising present relief and her father's hospitality
when he should become acquainted with the facts. She called back
her scattered maidens, chiding their alarm and reminding them
that the Ph&aelig;acians had no enemies to fear. This man, she told
them, was an unhappy wanderer, whom it was a duty to cherish,
for the poor and the stranger are from Jove. She bade them bring
food, and the garments of some of her brothers that were among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
the contents of the wagon. When this was done, and Ulysses retiring
to a sheltered place had washed his body free from the sea-foam,
and clothed himself, and eaten, Pallas dilated his form and
diffused grace over his ample chest and manly brows.</p>

<p>The princess, seeing him, was filled with admiration and scrupled
not to say to her damsels that she wished the gods would send her
such a husband. To Ulysses she recommended that he repair to
the city, following herself and her train so far as the way lay through
the fields; but when they should approach the city, she desired
that he no longer be seen in her company, for she feared the remarks
which rude and vulgar people might make on seeing her
return accompanied by such a gallant stranger. To avoid this she
directed him to stop at a grove adjoining the city, in which were
a farm and garden belonging to the king. After allowing time for
the princess and her companions to reach the city, he was then to
pursue his way thither, and should be easily guided by any he
might meet to the royal abode.</p>

<p>Ulysses obeyed the directions and in due time proceeded to
the city, on approaching which he met a young woman bearing
forth a pitcher for water.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> It was Minerva who had assumed that
form. Ulysses accosted her and desired to be directed to the
palace of Alcino&uuml;s, the king. The maiden replied respectfully,
offering to be his guide; for the palace, she informed him, stood
near her father's dwelling. Under the guidance of the goddess
and, by her power, enveloped in a cloud which shielded him from
observation, Ulysses passed among the busy crowd and with wonder
observed their harbor, their ships, their forum (the resort of
heroes), and their battlements, till they came to the palace, where
the goddess, having first given him some information of the country,
king, and people he was about to meet, left him. Ulysses,
before entering the courtyard of the palace, stood and surveyed
the scene. Its splendor astonished him. Brazen walls stretched
from the entrance to the interior house, of which the doors were
gold, the doorposts silver, the lintels silver ornamented with gold.
On either side were figures of mastiffs wrought in gold and silver,
standing in rows as if to guard the approach. Along the walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>were seats spread through all their length with mantles of finest
texture, the work of Ph&aelig;acian maidens. On these seats the princes
sat and feasted, while golden statues of graceful youths held in
their hands lighted torches which shed radiance over the scene.
Full fifty female menials served in household offices, some employed
to grind the corn, others to wind off the purple wool or ply
the loom. For the Ph&aelig;acian women as far exceeded all other
women in household arts as the mariners of that country did the
rest of mankind in the management of ships. Without the court
a spacious garden lay, four acres in extent. In it grew many a lofty
tree, pomegranate, pear, apple, fig, and olive. Neither winter's
cold nor summer's drought arrested their growth.</p>

<p>Ulysses stood gazing in admiration, unobserved himself, for the
cloud which Minerva spread around him still shielded him. At
length having sufficiently observed the scene, he advanced with
rapid step into the hall where the chiefs and senators were assembled,
pouring libation to Mercury, whose worship followed the evening
meal. Just then Minerva dissolved the cloud and disclosed him to
the assembled chiefs. Advancing to the place where the queen sat,
he knelt at her feet and implored her favor and assistance to enable
him to return to his native country. Then withdrawing, he
seated himself in the manner of suppliants, at the hearth-side.</p>

<p>For a time none spoke. At last an aged statesman, addressing
the king, said, "It is not fit that a stranger who asks our hospitality
should be kept waiting in suppliant guise, none welcoming
him. Let him, therefore, be led to a seat among us and supplied
with food and wine." At these words the king, rising, gave his
hand to Ulysses and led him to a seat, displacing thence his own
son to make room for the stranger. Food and wine were set
before him and he ate and refreshed himself.</p>

<p>The king then dismissed his guests, notifying them that the
next day he would call them to council to consider what had best
be done for the stranger.</p>

<p>When the guests had departed and Ulysses was left alone with
the king and queen, the queen asked him who he was and whence
he came, and (recognizing the clothes which he wore as those
which her maidens and herself had made) from whom he received
those garments. He told them of his residence in Calypso's isle
and his departure thence; of the wreck of his raft, his escape by
swimming, and of the relief afforded by the princess. The parents
heard approvingly, and the king promised to furnish a ship in
which his guest might return to his own land.</p>

<p>The next day the assembled chiefs confirmed the promise of
the king.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> A bark was prepared and a crew of stout rowers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>selected, and all betook themselves to the palace, where a bounteous
repast was provided. After the feast the king proposed that the
young men should show their guest their proficiency in manly
sports, and all went forth to the arena for games of running,
wrestling, and other exercises. After all had done their best,
Ulysses being challenged to show what he could do, at first declined,
but being taunted by one of the youths, seized a quoit of
weight far heavier than any the Ph&aelig;acians had thrown, and sent
it farther than the utmost throw of theirs. All were astonished
and viewed their guest with greatly increased respect.</p>

<p>After the games they returned to the hall, and the herald led in
Demodocus, the blind bard,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Dear to the Muse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who yet appointed him both good and ill,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>He took for his theme the Wooden Horse, by means of which the
Greeks found entrance into Troy. Apollo inspired him, and he
sang so feelingly the terrors and the exploits of that eventful time
that all were delighted, but Ulysses was moved to tears. Observing
which, Alcino&uuml;s, when the song was done, demanded of him
why at the mention of Troy his sorrows awaked. Had he lost
there a father, or brother, or any dear friend? Ulysses replied by
announcing himself by his true name, and, at their request, recounted
the adventures which had befallen him since his departure
from Troy. This narrative raised the sympathy and admiration of
the Ph&aelig;acians for their guest to the highest pitch. The king proposed
that all the chiefs should present him with a gift, himself
setting the example. They obeyed, and vied with one another in
loading the illustrious stranger with costly gifts.</p>

<p>The next day Ulysses set sail in the Ph&aelig;acian vessel, and in a
short time arrived safe at Ithaca, his own island.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> When the vessel
touched the strand he was asleep. The mariners, without waking
him, carried him on shore, and landed with him the chest
containing his presents, and then sailed away.</p>

<p>Neptune was so displeased at the conduct of the Ph&aelig;acians in
thus rescuing Ulysses from his hands, that, on the return of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>vessel to port, he transformed it into a rock, right opposite the
mouth of the harbor.</p>

<p><b>243. Fate of the Suitors.</b> Ulysses had now been away from
Ithaca for twenty years, and when he awoke he did not recognize
his native land:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some god hath cast me forth upon this land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And O! what land? So thick is the sea mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All is phantasmal. What king ruleth here?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What folk inhabit?&mdash;cruel unto strangers,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But Minerva, appearing in the form of a young shepherd, informed
him where he was, and told him the state of things at his palace.
More than a hundred nobles of Ithaca and of the neighboring
islands had been for years suing for the hand of Penelope, his
wife, imagining him dead, and lording it over his palace and
people as if they were owners of both.</p>

<p>Penelope was one of those mythic heroines whose beauties were
not those of person only, but of character and conduct as well.
She was the niece of Tyndareus,&mdash;being the daughter of his
brother Icarius, a Spartan prince. Ulysses, seeking her in marriage,
had won her over all competitors. But, when the moment
came for the bride to leave her father's house, Icarius, unable to
bear the thoughts of parting with his daughter, tried to persuade
her to remain with him and not accompany her husband to Ithaca.
Ulysses gave Penelope her choice, to stay or go with him. Penelope
made no reply, but dropped her veil over her face. Icarius urged
her no further, but when she was gone erected a statue to Modesty
on the spot where they had parted.</p>

<p>Ulysses and Penelope had not enjoyed their union more than a
year when it was interrupted by the events which called Ulysses
to the Trojan War. During his long absence, and when it was
doubtful whether he still lived, and highly improbable that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>would ever return, Penelope was importuned by numerous suitors,
from whom there seemed no refuge but in choosing one of them
for her husband. She, however, employed every art to gain time,
still hoping for Ulysses' return. One of her arts of delay was by
engaging in the preparation of a robe for the funeral canopy of
La&euml;rtes, her husband's father. She pledged herself to make her
choice among the suitors when the web was finished. During the
day she worked at it, but in the night she undid the work of the day.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 176. Penelope and Telemachus</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>That Ulysses on returning might be able to take vengeance
upon the suitors, it was important that he should not be recognized.
Minerva accordingly metamorphosed him into an unsightly
beggar, and as such he was kindly received by Eum&aelig;us, the swineherd,
a faithful servant of his house.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>Telemachus, his son, had for some time been absent in quest
of his father, visiting the courts of the other kings who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>returned from the Trojan expedition. While on the search, he
received counsel from Minerva to return home.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> He arrived
at this juncture, and sought Eum&aelig;us to learn something of the
state of affairs at the palace before presenting himself among
the suitors. Finding a stranger with Eum&aelig;us, he treated him
courteously, though in the garb of a beggar, and promised him
assistance. Eum&aelig;us was sent to the palace to inform Penelope
privately of her son's arrival, for caution was necessary with regard
to the suitors, who, as Telemachus had learned, were plotting to
intercept and kill him. When the swineherd was gone, Minerva
presented herself to Ulysses and directed him to make himself
known to his son. At the same time she touched him, removed
at once from him the appearance of age and penury, and gave him
the aspect of vigorous manhood that belonged to him. Telemachus
viewed him with astonishment, and at first thought he must
be more than mortal. But Ulysses announced himself as his father,
and accounted for the change of appearance by explaining that it
was Minerva's doing.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">Then threw Telemachus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His arms around his father's neck and wept.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The father and son took counsel together how they should get
the better of the suitors and punish them for their outrages. It
was arranged that Telemachus should proceed to the palace and
mingle with the suitors as formerly; that Ulysses should also go
as a beggar, a character which in the rude old times had different
privileges from what we concede to it now. As traveler and storyteller,
the beggar was admitted in the halls of chieftains and often
treated like a guest; though sometimes, also, no doubt, with contumely.
Ulysses charged his son not to betray, by any display of
unusual interest in him, that he knew him to be other than he
seemed, and even if he saw him insulted or beaten, not to interpose
otherwise than he might do for any stranger. At the palace
they found the usual scene of feasting and riot going on. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>suitors pretended to receive Telemachus with joy at his return,
though secretly mortified at the failure of their plots to take his
life. The old beggar was permitted to enter and provided with a
portion from the table. A touching incident occurred as Ulysses
entered the courtyard of the palace. An old dog lay in the yard
almost dead with age, and seeing a stranger enter, raised his head,
with ears erect. It was Argus, Ulysses' own dog, that he had in
other days often led to the chase.</p>

</div>

<p>As Ulysses sat eating his portion in the hall, the suitors soon
began to exhibit their insolence to him. When he mildly remonstrated,
one of them
raised a stool and with
it gave him a blow.
Telemachus had hard
work to restrain his indignation
at seeing his
father so treated in his
own hall; but, remembering
his father's injunctions,
said no more
than what became him
as master of the house,
though young, and protector
of his guests.</p>

<p>Once again was the wanderer all but betrayed;&mdash;when his
aged nurse Euryclea, bathing his feet, recognized the scar of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>a wound dealt him by a boar, long ago.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Grief and joy overwhelmed
the crone, and she would have revealed him to Penelope
had not Ulysses enjoined silence upon her.</p>

<p>Penelope had protracted her decision in favor of any one of her
suitors so long that there seemed to be no further pretense for
delay. The continued absence of her husband seemed to prove
that his return was no longer to be expected. Meanwhile her
son had grown up and was able to manage his own affairs. She
therefore consented to submit the question of her choice to a trial
of skill among the suitors. The test selected was shooting with the
bow.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Twelve rings were arranged in a line, and he whose arrow
was sent through the whole twelve was to have the queen for his
prize. A bow that one of his brother heroes had given to Ulysses
in former times was brought from the armory and with its quiver
full of arrows was laid in the hall. Telemachus had taken care that
all other weapons should be removed, under pretense that in the
heat of competition there was danger, in some rash moment, of
putting them to an improper use.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 178. Ulysses kills the Suitors</span></p>

<p>(Left half)</p></div>
</div>

<p>All things being prepared for the trial, the first thing to be done
was to bend the bow in order to attach the string. Telemachus
endeavored to do it, but found all his efforts fruitless; and modestly
confessing that he had attempted a task beyond his strength,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>he yielded the bow to another, <i>He</i> tried it with no better success,
and, amidst the laughter and jeers of his companions, gave it up.
Another tried it, and another; they rubbed the bow with tallow, but
all to no purpose; it would not bend. Then spoke Ulysses, humbly
suggesting that he should be permitted to try; for, said he,
"beggar as I am, I was once a soldier, and there is still some
strength in these old limbs of mine." The suitors hooted with
derision and commanded to turn him out of the hall for his insolence.
But Telemachus spoke up for him, and, merely to gratify
the old man, bade him try. Ulysses took the bow and handled it
with the hand of a master. With ease he adjusted the cord to its
notch, then fitting an arrow to the bow he drew the string and
sped the arrow unerring through the rings.</p>

<p>Without allowing them time to express their astonishment, he
said, "Now for another mark!" and aimed direct at Antino&uuml;s, the
most insolent of the suitors.<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> The arrow pierced through his throat
and he fell dead. Telemachus, Eum&aelig;us, and another faithful follower,
well armed, now sprang to the side of Ulysses. The suitors,
in amazement, looked round for arms, but found none, neither
was there any way of escape, for Eum&aelig;us had secured the door.
Ulysses left them not long in uncertainty; he announced himself
as the long-lost chief, whose house they had invaded, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>substance they had squandered, whose wife and son they had persecuted
for ten long years; and told them he meant to have ample
vengeance. All but two were slain, and Ulysses was left master of
his palace and possessor of his kingdom and his wife.</p>

<p><b>244. Tennyson's Ulysses.</b> Tennyson's poem of Ulysses represents
the old hero,&mdash;his dangers past and nothing left but to
stay at home and be happy,&mdash;growing tired of inaction and resolving
to set forth again in quest of new adventures.</p>

<p><b>245. From Troy to Italy.</b> Homer tells the story of one of the
Grecian heroes, Ulysses, in his wanderings on his return home
from Troy. Virgil in his &AElig;neid<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> narrates the mythical fortunes of
the remnant of the <i>conquered</i> people under their chief &AElig;neas,
the son of Venus and the Trojan Anchises, in their search for a
new home after the ruin of their native city. On that fatal night
when the wooden horse disgorged its contents of armed men, and
the capture and conflagration of the city were the result, &AElig;neas
made his escape from the scene of
destruction, with his father and his
wife and young son. The father,
Anchises, was too old to walk with
the speed required, and &AElig;neas took
him upon his shoulders. Thus burdened,
leading his son and followed
by his wife, he made the best of his
way out of the burning city; but in
the confusion his wife, Cre&uuml;sa, was
swept away and lost.</p>

<span class="smcap">and Iulius</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><b>246. The Departure from Troy.</b> On arriving at the place of rendezvous,
numerous fugitives of both sexes were found, who put themselves
under the guidance of &AElig;neas. Some months were spent in preparation,
and at length they embarked. They first landed on the
neighboring shores of Thrace, and were preparing to build a city,
but &AElig;neas was deterred by a prodigy. Preparing to offer sacrifice,
he tore some twigs from one of the bushes. To his dismay the
wounded part dropped blood. When he repeated the act, a voice
from the ground cried out to him, "Spare me, &AElig;neas; I am thy
kinsman, Polydore, here murdered with many arrows, from which
a bush has grown, nourished with my blood." These words recalled
to the recollection of &AElig;neas that Polydore was a young prince of
Troy, whom his father had sent with ample treasures to the neighboring
land of Thrace, to be there brought up, at a distance from
the horrors of war. The king to whom he was sent had murdered
him and seized his treasures. &AElig;neas and his companions, considering
the land accursed by the stain of such a crime, hastened away.</p>

<p><b>247. The Promised Empire.</b> They next landed on the island of
Delos. Here &AElig;neas consulted the oracle of Apollo, and received
an answer, ambiguous as usual,&mdash;"Seek thy ancient mother;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
there the race of &AElig;neas shall dwell, and reduce all other nations
to their sway." The Trojans heard with joy and immediately
began to ask one another, "Where is the spot intended by the
oracle?" Anchises remembered that there was a tradition that
their forefathers came from Crete, and thither they resolved to
steer. They arrived at Crete and began to build their city; but
sickness broke out among them, and the fields that they had
planted, failed to yield a crop. In this gloomy aspect of affairs,
&AElig;neas was warned in a dream to leave the country and seek a
western land called Hesperia, whence Dardanus, the true founder
of the Trojan race, was reported to have migrated. To Hesperia,
now called Italy, they therefore directed their future course, and
not till after many adventures, and the lapse of time sufficient to
carry a modern navigator several times round the world, did they
arrive there.</p>

<p><b>248. The Harpies.</b> Their first landing was at the island of the
Harpies. These were disgusting birds, with the heads of maidens,
with long claws, and faces pale with hunger. They were sent by
the gods to torment a certain Phineus, whom Jupiter had deprived
of his sight in punishment of his cruelty; and whenever a meal
was placed before him, the harpies darted down from the air and
carried it off. They were driven away from Phineus by the heroes
of the Argonautic expedition, and took refuge in the island where
&AElig;neas now found them. When the Trojans entered the port they
saw herds of cattle roaming over the plain. They slew as many as
they wished, and prepared for a feast. But no sooner had they
seated themselves at the table than a horrible clamor was heard
in the air, and a flock of these odious harpies came rushing down
upon them, seizing in their talons the meat from the dishes and
flying away with it. &AElig;neas and his companions drew their swords
and dealt vigorous blows among the monsters, but to no purpose,
for they were so nimble it was almost impossible to hit them, and
their feathers were, like armor, impenetrable to steel. One of them,
perched on a neighboring cliff, screamed out, "Is it thus, Trojans,
ye treat us innocent birds, first slaughter our cattle and then make
war on ourselves?" She then predicted dire sufferings to them
in their future course, and, having vented her wrath, flew away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<p><b>249. Epirus.</b> The Trojans made haste to leave the country, and
next found themselves coasting along the shore of Epirus. Here
they landed and to their astonishment learned that certain Trojan
exiles, who had been carried there as prisoners, had become rulers
of the country. Andromache, the widow of Hector, had borne
three sons to Neoptolemus in Epirus. But when he cast her off
for Hermione, he left her to her fellow-captive, Helenus, Hector's
brother. Now that Neoptolemus was dead she had become the
wife of Helenus; and they ruled the realm. Helenus and Andromache
treated the exiles with the utmost hospitality, and dismissed
them loaded with gifts.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/image198.jpg" width="300" height="282" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 182. Scylla</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><b>250. The Cyclopes Again.</b> From hence &AElig;neas coasted along
the shore of Sicily and passed the country of the Cyclopes. Here
they were hailed from the shore by a miserable object, whom by his
garments tattered, as they were, they perceived to be a Greek.
He told them he was one of Ulysses' companions, left behind
by that chief in his hurried departure. He related the
story of Ulysses' adventure with Polyphemus, and besought them
to take him off with them, as he had no means of sustaining
his existence where he was, but wild berries and roots, and lived
in constant fear of the Cyclopes. While he spoke Polyphemus
made his appearance,&mdash;terrible, shapeless, vast, and, of course,
blind.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> He walked with cautious steps, feeling his way with a
staff, down to the seaside, to wash his eye-socket in the waves.
When he reached the water he waded out towards them, and his
immense height enabled him to advance far into the sea, so that
the Trojans in terror took to their oars to get out of his way.
Hearing the oars, Polyphemus shouted after them so that the
shores resounded, and at the noise the other Cyclopes came forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>from their caves and woods, and lined the shore, like a row of
lofty pine trees. The Trojans plied their oars and soon left them
out of sight.</p>

<p>&AElig;neas had been cautioned by Helenus to avoid the strait guarded
by the monsters Scylla and Charybdis. There Ulysses, the reader
will remember, had lost six of his men, seized by Scylla while the
navigators were wholly intent upon avoiding Charybdis. &AElig;neas,
following the advice of Helenus, shunned the dangerous pass and
coasted along the island of Sicily.</p>

<p><b>251. The Resentment of Juno.</b> Now Juno, seeing the Trojans
speeding their way prosperously towards their destined shore, felt
her old grudge against them revive, for she could not forget the
slight that Paris had put upon her in awarding the prize of beauty
to another. In heavenly minds can such resentment dwell!<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
Accordingly she gave orders to &AElig;olus, who sent forth his sons,
Boreas, Typhon, and the other winds, to toss the ocean. A terrible
storm ensued, and the Trojan ships were driven out of their course
towards the coast of Africa. They were in imminent danger of
being wrecked, and were separated, so that &AElig;neas thought that
all were lost except his own vessel.</p>

<p>At this crisis, Neptune, hearing the storm raging, and knowing
that he had given no orders for one, raised his head above the
waves and saw the fleet of &AElig;neas driving before the gale. Understanding
the hostility of Juno, he was at no loss to account for it,
but his anger was not the less at this interference in his province.
He called the winds and dismissed them with a severe reprimand.
He then soothed the waves, and brushed away the clouds from
before the face of the sun. Some of the ships which had got on
the rocks he pried off with his own trident, while Triton and a
sea-nymph, putting their shoulders under others, set them afloat
again. The Trojans, when the sea became calm, sought the nearest
shore,&mdash;the coast of Carthage, where &AElig;neas was so happy as
to find that one by one the ships all arrived safe, though badly
shaken.</p>

<p><b>252. The Sojourn at Carthage. Dido.</b> Carthage, where the
exiles had now arrived, was a spot on the coast of Africa opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>Sicily, where at that time a Tyrian colony under Dido, their queen,
were laying the foundations of a state destined in later ages to be
the rival of Rome itself. Dido was the daughter of Belus, king of
Tyre, and sister of Pygmalion, who succeeded his father on the
throne. Her husband was Sich&aelig;us, a man of immense wealth,
but Pygmalion, who coveted his treasures, caused him to be put to
death. Dido, with a numerous body of friends and followers, both
men and women, succeeded in effecting their escape from Tyre, in
several vessels, carrying with them the treasures of Sich&aelig;us. On
arriving at the spot which they selected as the seat of their future
home, they asked of the natives only so much land as they could
inclose with a bull's hide. When this was readily granted, the
queen caused the hide to be cut into strips, and with them inclosed
a spot on which she built a citadel, and called it Byrsa
(a hide). Around this fort the city of Carthage rose, and soon
became a powerful and flourishing place.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when &AElig;neas with his Trojans arrived
there. Dido received the illustrious exiles with friendliness
and hospitality. "Not unacquainted with distress," she said, "I
have learned to succor the unfortunate."<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> The queen's hospitality
displayed itself in festivities at which games of strength and skill
were exhibited. The strangers contended for the palm with her
own subjects on equal terms, the queen declaring that whether
the victor were "Trojan or Tyrian should make no difference to
her."<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> At the feast which followed the games, &AElig;neas gave at her
request a recital of the closing events of the Trojan history and his
own adventures after the fall of the city. Dido was charmed with
his discourse and filled with admiration of his exploits. She conceived
an ardent passion for him, and he for his part seemed well
content to accept the fortunate chance which appeared to offer
him at once a happy termination of his wanderings, a home, a
kingdom, and a bride. Months rolled away in the enjoyment of
pleasant intercourse, and it seemed as if Italy and the empire
destined to be founded on its shores were alike forgotten. Seeing
which, Jupiter dispatched Mercury with a message to &AElig;neas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>recalling him to a sense of his high destiny, and commanding him
to resume his voyage.</p>

<p>&AElig;neas parted from Dido, though she tried every allurement and
persuasion to detain him. The blow to her affection and her pride
was too much for her to endure, and when she found that he was
gone, she mounted a funeral pile which she had caused to be prepared,
and having stabbed herself was consumed with the pile.
The flames rising over the city were seen by the departing Trojans,
and, though the cause was unknown, gave to &AElig;neas some
intimation of the fatal event.</p>

<p><b>253. Palinurus. Italy at Last.</b> After touching at the island
of Sicily, where Acestes, a prince of Trojan lineage, bore sway,
and gave them a hospitable reception, the Trojans re&euml;mbarked
and held on their course for Italy. Venus now interceded with
Neptune to allow her son at last to attain the wished-for goal and
find an end of his perils on the deep. Neptune consented, stipulating
only for one life as a ransom for the rest. The victim was
Palinurus, the pilot. As he sat watching the stars with his hand
on the helm, Somnus, sent by Neptune, approached in the guise of
Phorbas, and said, "Palinurus, the breeze is fair, the water smooth,
and the ship sails steadily on her course. Lie down awhile and
take needful rest. I will stand at the helm in thy place." Palinurus
replied, "Tell me not of smooth seas or favoring winds,&mdash;me who
have seen so much of their treachery. Shall I trust &AElig;neas to
the chances of the weather and the winds?" And he continued
to grasp the helm and to keep his eyes fixed on the stars. But
Somnus waved over him a branch moistened with Leth&aelig;an dew,
and his eyes closed in spite of all his efforts. Then Somnus pushed
him overboard, and he fell; but as he kept his hold upon the helm,
it came away with him. Neptune was mindful of his promise, and
held the ship on her track without helm or pilot till &AElig;neas discovered
his loss and, sorrowing deeply for his faithful steersman,
took charge of the ship himself. Under his guidance the ships
at last reached the shores of Italy, and joyfully the adventurers
leaped to land.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 183. The Cum&aelig;an Sibyl</span></p>

<p>From the painting by Michelangelo</p></div>
</div>

<p><b>254. The Sibyl of Cum&aelig;.</b> While his people were employed in
making their encampment, &AElig;neas sought the abode of the Sibyl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
It was a cave connected with a temple and grove, sacred to Apollo
and Diana. While &AElig;neas contemplated the scene, the Sibyl accosted
him. She seemed to know his errand, and, under the influence
of the deity of the place, burst forth in a prophetic strain,
giving dark intimations of labors and perils through which he was
destined to make his way to final success. She closed with the encouraging
words which
have become proverbial:
"Yield not to
disasters, but press
onward the more
bravely."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> &AElig;neas replied
that he had
prepared himself for
whatever might await
him. He had but one
request to make. Having
been directed in
a dream to seek the
abode of the dead in
order to confer with
his father Anchises to
receive from him a
revelation of his future
fortunes and those of
his race, he asked her
assistance to enable
him to accomplish the
task. The Sibyl replied:
"The descent to Avernus is easy; the gate of Pluto stands
open night and day; but to retrace one's steps and return to the
upper air, that is the toil, that the difficulty."<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> She instructed him
to seek in the forest a tree on which grew a golden branch. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>branch was to be plucked off and borne as a gift to Proserpine,
and if fate was propitious, it would yield to the hand and quit its
parent trunk, but otherwise no force could rend it away. If torn
away, another would succeed.</p>

<p>&AElig;neas followed the directions of the Sibyl. His mother, Venus,
sent two of her doves to fly before him and show him the way,
and by their assistance he found the tree, plucked the branch,
and hastened back with it to the Sibyl.</p>

<p><b>255. The Infernal Regions.</b> The region where Virgil locates
the entrance to the infernal regions is, perhaps, the most strikingly
adapted to excite ideas of the terrific and preternatural of any on
the face of the earth. It is the volcanic region near Vesuvius,
where the whole country is cleft with chasms from which sulphurous
flames arise, while the ground is shaken with pent-up vapors,
and mysterious sounds issue from the bowels of the earth. The
lake Avernus is supposed to fill the crater of an extinct volcano.
It is circular, half a mile wide and very deep, surrounded by high
banks, which in Virgil's time were covered with a gloomy forest.
Mephitic vapors rise from its waters, so that no life is found on
its banks, and no birds fly over it. Here &AElig;neas offered sacrifices
to the infernal deities, Proserpine, Hecate, and the Furies. Then
a roaring was heard in the earth, the woods on the hilltops were
shaken, and the howling of dogs announced the approach of the
deities. "Now," said the Sibyl, "summon thy courage, for thou
shalt need it." She descended into the cave of Avernus, and
&AElig;neas followed. Before the threshold of hell they passed through
a group of beings who are enumerated as Griefs and avenging
Cares, pale Diseases, and melancholy Age, Fear and Hunger that
tempt to crime, Toil, Poverty, and Death,&mdash;forms horrible to view.
The Furies spread their couches there, and Discord, whose hair
was of vipers tied up with a bloody fillet. Here also were the
monsters, Briareus, with his hundred arms, Hydras hissing, and
Chim&aelig;ras breathing fire. &AElig;neas shuddered at the sight, drew his
sword and would have struck, but the Sibyl restrained him. They
then came to the black river Cocytus, where they found the ferryman
Charon, old and squalid, but strong and vigorous, who was
receiving passengers of all kinds into his boat, stout-hearted heroes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
boys and unmarried girls, as numerous as the leaves that fall at
autumn or the flocks that fly southward at the approach of winter.
They stood pressing for a passage and longing to touch the opposite
shore. But the stern ferryman took in only such as he chose,
driving the rest back. &AElig;neas, wondering at the sight, asked the
Sibyl, "Why this discrimination?" She answered, "Those who
are taken on board the bark are the souls of those who have received
due burial rites; the host of others who have remained unburied
are not permitted to pass the flood, but wander a hundred
years, and flit to and fro about the shore, till at last they are taken
over." &AElig;neas grieved at recollecting some of his own companions
who had perished in the storm. At that moment he beheld
Palinurus, his pilot, who fell overboard and was drowned. He addressed
him and asked him the cause of his misfortune. Palinurus
replied that the rudder was carried away, and he, clinging to it, was
swept away with it. He besought &AElig;neas most urgently to extend
to him his hand and take him in company to the opposite shore.
The Sibyl rebuked him for the wish thus to transgress the laws
of Pluto, but consoled him by informing him that the people of
the shore where his body had been wafted by the waves should
be stirred up by prodigies to give it due burial, and that the promontory
should bear the name of Cape Palinurus,&mdash;and so it does
to this day. Leaving Palinurus consoled by these words, they approached
the boat. Charon, fixing his eyes sternly upon the advancing
warrior, demanded by what right he, living and armed,
approached that shore. To which the Sibyl replied that they would
commit no violence, that &AElig;neas' only object was to see his father,
and finally exhibited the golden branch, at sight of which Charon's
wrath relaxed, and he made haste to turn his bark to the shore
and receive them on board. The boat, adapted only to the light
freight of bodiless spirits, groaned under the weight of the hero.
They were soon conveyed to the opposite shore. There they were
encountered by the three-headed dog Cerberus, with his necks
bristling with snakes. He barked with all three throats till the
Sibyl threw him a medicated cake, which he eagerly devoured, and
then stretched himself out in his den and fell asleep. &AElig;neas and
the Sibyl sprang to land. The first sound that struck their ears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
was the wailing of young children who had died on the threshold
of life; and near to these were those who had perished under false
charges. Minos presides over them as judge and examines the
deeds of each. The next class was of those who had died by their
own hand, hating life and seeking refuge in death. How willingly
would they now endure poverty, labor, and any other infliction
if they might but return to life! Next were situated the regions
of sadness, divided off into retired paths, leading through groves
of myrtle. Here roamed those who had fallen victims to unrequited
love, not freed from pain even by death itself. Among these
&AElig;neas thought he descried the form of Dido, with a wound still
recent. In the dim light he was for a moment uncertain, but
approaching, perceived it was indeed she. Tears fell from his
eyes, and he addressed her in the accents of love. "Unhappy
Dido! was then the rumor true that thou hadst perished? And
was I, alas! the cause? I call the gods to witness that my departure
from thee was reluctant and in obedience to the commands
of Jove; nor could I believe that my absence would have cost thee
so dear. Stop, I beseech thee, and refuse me not a last farewell."
She stood for a moment with averted countenance and eyes fixed
on the ground, and then silently passed on, as insensible to his
pleadings as a rock. &AElig;neas followed for some distance, then
with a heavy heart rejoined his companion and resumed his route.</p>

<p>They next entered the fields where roam the heroes who have
fallen in battle. Here they saw many shades of Grecian and Trojan
warriors. The Trojans thronged around him and could not
be satisfied with the sight. They asked the cause of his coming
and plied him with innumerable questions. But the Greeks, at the
sight of his armor glittering through the murky atmosphere, recognized
the hero, and, filled with terror, turned their backs and fled,
as they used to do on the plains of Troy.</p>

<p>&AElig;neas would have lingered long with his Trojan friends, but
the Sibyl hurried him away. They next came to a place where the
road divided, the one way leading to Elysium, the other to the
regions of the condemned. &AElig;neas beheld on one side the walls
of a mighty city, around which Phlegethon rolled its fiery waters.
Before him was the gate of adamant that neither gods nor men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
can break through. An iron tower stood by the gate, on which
Tisiphone, the avenging Fury, kept guard. From the city were
heard groans, and the sound of the scourge, the creaking of iron,
and the clanking of chains. &AElig;neas, horror-stricken, inquired of
his guide what crimes were those whose punishments produced
the sounds he heard. The Sibyl answered, "Here is the judgment
hall of Rhadamanthus, who brings to light crimes done in life
which the perpetrator vainly thought impenetrably hid. Tisiphone
applies her whip of scorpions and delivers the offender over to
her sister Furies." At this moment with horrid clang the brazen
gates unfolded, and within, &AElig;neas saw a Hydra with fifty heads
guarding the entrance. The Sibyl told him that the gulf of Tartarus
descended deep, so that its recesses were as far beneath their
feet as heaven was high above their heads. In the bottom of this
pit the Titan race, who warred against the gods, lie prostrate;
Salmoneus also, who presumed to vie with Jupiter, and built a
bridge of brass over which he drove his chariot that the sound
might resemble thunder, launching flaming brands at his people
in imitation of lightning, till Jupiter struck him with a real thunderbolt
and taught him the difference between mortal weapons and
divine. Here also is Tityus, the giant, whose form is so immense
that, as he lies, he stretches over nine acres, while a vulture preys
upon his liver, which as fast as it is devoured grows again, so that
his punishment will have no end.</p>

<p>&AElig;neas saw groups seated at tables loaded with dainties, while
near by stood a Fury who snatched away the viands from their lips
as fast as they prepared to taste them. Others beheld suspended
over their heads huge rocks, threatening to fall, keeping them in
a state of constant alarm. These were they who had hated their
brothers, or struck their parents, or defrauded the friends who
trusted them, or who, having grown rich, kept their money to
themselves and gave no share to others,&mdash;the last being the most
numerous class. Here also were those who had violated the marriage
vow, or fought in a bad cause, or failed in fidelity to their
employers. Here was one who had sold his country for gold,
another who perverted the laws, making them say one thing to-day
and another to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>Ixion was there, fastened to the circumference of a wheel ceaselessly
revolving; and Sisyphus, whose task was to roll a huge stone
up to a hilltop; but when the steep was well-nigh gained, the rock,
repulsed by some sudden force, rushed again headlong down to
the plain. Again he toiled at it, while the sweat bathed all his
weary limbs, but all to no effect. There was Tantalus, who stood
in a pool his chin level with the water, yet he was parched with
thirst and found nothing to assuage it; for when he bowed his
hoary head, eager to quaff, the water fled away, leaving the ground
at his feet all dry. Tall trees, laden with fruit, stooped their heads
to him,&mdash;pears, pomegranates, apples, and luscious figs; but when,
with a sudden grasp, he tried to seize them, winds whirled them
high above his reach.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 184. Ixion on the Wheel</span></p></div>
</div>

<p><b>256. The Elysian Fields.</b> The Sibyl now warned &AElig;neas that
it was time to turn from these melancholy regions and seek the
city of the blessed. They passed through a middle tract of darkness
and came upon the Elysian Fields, the groves where the happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
reside. They breathed a freer air and saw all objects clothed in a
purple light. The region had a sun and stars of its own. The
inhabitants were enjoying themselves in various ways, some in
sports on the grassy turf, in games of strength or skill, others
dancing or singing. Orpheus struck the chords of his lyre and
called forth ravishing sounds. Here &AElig;neas saw the founders of
the Trojan state, great-hearted heroes who lived in happier times.
He gazed with admiration on the war chariots and glittering arms
now reposing in disuse. Spears stood fixed in the ground, and the
horses, unharnessed, roamed over the plain. The same pride in
splendid armor and generous steeds which the old heroes felt in
life accompanied them here. He saw another group feasting and
listening to the strains of music. They were in a laurel grove,
whence the great river Po has its origin and flows out among
men. Here dwelt those who fell by wounds received in their
country's cause, holy priests also, and poets who have uttered
thoughts worthy of Apollo, and others who have contributed to
cheer and adorn life by their discoveries in the useful arts, and
have made their memory blessed by rendering service to mankind.
They wore snow-white fillets about their brows. The Sibyl addressed
a group of these and inquired where Anchises was to be
found. They were directed where to seek him, and soon found
him in a verdant valley, where he was contemplating the ranks
of his posterity, their destinies and worthy deeds to be achieved
in coming times. When he recognized &AElig;neas approaching, he
stretched out both hands to him, while tears flowed freely. "Dost
thou come at last," said he, "long expected, and do I behold thee
after such perils past? O my son, how have I trembled for thee,
as I have watched thy course!" To which &AElig;neas replied, "O
father! thy image was always before me to guide and guard me."
Then he endeavored to infold his father in his embrace, but his
arms inclosed only an unsubstantial shade.</p>

<p><b>257. The Valley of Oblivion.</b> &AElig;neas perceived before him a
spacious valley, with trees gently waving to the wind, a tranquil
landscape, through which the river Lethe flowed. Along the banks
of the stream wandered a countless multitude, numerous as insects
in the summer air. &AElig;neas, with surprise, inquired who were these.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
Anchises answered: "They are souls to which bodies are to be
given in due time. Meanwhile they dwell on Lethe's bank and
drink oblivion of their former lives." "O father!" said &AElig;neas, "is
it possible that any can be so in love with life as to wish to leave
these tranquil seats for the upper world?" Anchises replied by
explaining the plan of creation. The Creator, he told him, originally
made the material of which souls are composed, of the four
elements, fire, air, earth, and water, all which when united took
the form of the most excellent part, fire, and became <i>flame</i>. This
material was scattered like seed among the heavenly bodies, the
sun, moon, and stars. Of this seed the inferior gods created man
and all other animals, mingling it with various proportions of earth,
by which its purity was alloyed and reduced. Thus the more earth
predominates in the composition, the less pure is the individual;
and we see that men and women with their full-grown bodies have
not the purity of childhood. So in proportion to the time which
the union of body and soul has lasted, is the impurity contracted
by the spiritual part. This impurity must be purged away after
death, which is done by ventilating the souls in the current of
winds, or merging them in water, or burning out their impurities
by fire. Some few, of whom Anchises intimates that he is one,
are admitted at once to Elysium, there to remain. But the rest,
after the impurities of earth are purged away, are sent back to life
endowed with new bodies, having had the remembrance of their
former lives effectually washed away by the waters of Lethe. Some
souls, however, there still are, so thoroughly corrupted that they
are not fit to be intrusted with human bodies, and these pass by
metempsychosis into the bodies of brute animals.</p>

<p>Anchises, having explained so much, proceeded to point out to
&AElig;neas individuals of his race who were hereafter to be born, and
to relate to him the exploits they should perform in the world.
After this he reverted to the present, and told his son of the
events that remained to him to be accomplished before the complete
establishment of himself and his followers in Italy. Wars
were to be waged, battles fought, a bride to be won, and, in the
result, a Trojan state founded, from which should rise the Roman
power, to be in time the sovereign of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p>As &AElig;neas and the Sibyl pursued their way back to earth, he
said to her: "Whether thou be a goddess or a mortal beloved by
the gods, by me thou shalt always be held in reverence. When I
reach the upper air, I will cause a temple to be built to thy honor,
and will myself bring offerings." "I am no goddess," said the
Sibyl; "I have no claims to sacrifice or offering. I am mortal,
yet, could I but have accepted the love of Apollo, I might have
been immortal. He promised me the fulfillment of my wish, if I
would consent to be his. I took a handful of sand and, holding it
forth, said, 'Grant me to see as many birthdays as there are sand-grains
in my hand.' Unluckily I forgot to ask for enduring youth.
This also he would have granted could I have accepted his love,
but, offended at my refusal, he allowed me to grow old. My youth
and youthful strength fled long ago. I have lived seven hundred
years, and to equal the number of the sand-grains I have still to
see three hundred springs and three hundred harvests. My body
shrinks up as years increase, and in time I shall be lost to sight,
but my voice will remain, and future ages will respect my sayings."</p>

<p>These concluding words of the Sibyl alluded to her prophetic
power. In her cave she was accustomed to inscribe on leaves
gathered from the trees the names and fates of individuals. The
leaves thus inscribed were arranged in order within the cave, and
might be consulted by her votaries. But if, perchance, at the
opening of the door the wind rushed in and dispersed the leaves,
the Sibyl gave no aid to restoring them again, and the oracle was
irreparably lost.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />

<span class="ph4">THE WAR BETWEEN TROJANS AND LATINS</span></h3>


<p><b>258. The Fulfillment of Prophecy.</b> &AElig;neas, having parted from
the Sibyl and rejoined his fleet, coasted along the shores of Italy
and cast anchor in the mouth of the Tiber. The poet, having
brought his hero to this spot, the destined termination of his wanderings,
invokes his Muse to tell him the situation of things at
that eventful moment. Latinus, third in descent from Saturn, ruled
the country. He was now old and had no male descendant, but
had one charming daughter, Lavinia, who was sought in marriage
by many neighboring chiefs, one of whom, Turnus, king of the
Rutulians, was favored by the wishes of her parents. But Latinus
had been warned in a dream by his father, Faunus, that the destined
husband of Lavinia should come from a foreign land. From that
union should spring a race destined to subdue the world.</p>

<p>Our readers will remember that in the conflict with the harpies,
one of those half-human birds had threatened the Trojans with
dire sufferings. In particular, she predicted that before their wanderings
ceased they should be pressed by hunger to devour their
tables. This portent now came true; for as they took their scanty
meal, seated on the grass, the men placed their hard biscuit on
their laps and put thereon whatever their gleanings in the woods
supplied. Having dispatched the latter, they finished by eating the
crusts. Seeing which, the boy Iulus said playfully, "See! we are
eating our tables." &AElig;neas caught the words and accepted the
omen. "All hail, promised land!" he exclaimed, "this is our
home, this our country!" He then took measures to find out who
were the present inhabitants of the land and who their rulers. A
hundred chosen men were sent to the village of Latinus, bearing
presents and a request for friendship and alliance. They went and
were favorably received. Latinus immediately concluded that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
Trojan hero was no other than the promised son-in-law announced
by the oracle. He cheerfully granted his alliance, and sent back
the messengers mounted on steeds from his stables and loaded
with gifts and friendly messages.</p>

<p>Juno, seeing things go thus prosperously for the Trojans, felt
her old animosity revive, summoned Alecto from Erebus, and sent
her to stir up discord. The Fury first took possession of the queen,
Amata, and roused her to oppose in every way the new alliance.
Alecto then sped to the city of Turnus and, assuming the form of
an old priestess, informed him of the arrival of the foreigners and
of the attempts of their prince to rob him of his betrothed. Next she
turned her attention to the camp of the Trojans. There she saw
the boy Iulus and his companions amusing themselves with hunting.
She sharpened the scent of the dogs and led them to rouse
up from the thicket a tame stag, the favorite of Silvia, the daughter
of Tyrrheus, the king's herdsman. A javelin from the hand of
Iulus wounded the animal, which had only strength left to run homeward
and die at its mistress's feet. Her cries and tears roused her
brothers and the herdsmen, and they, seizing whatever weapons
came to hand, furiously assaulted the hunting party. These were
protected by their friends, and the herdsmen were finally driven
back with the loss of two of their number.</p>

<p>These things were enough to rouse the storm of war, and the
queen, Turnus, and the peasants all urged the old king to drive
the strangers from the country. He resisted as long as he could,
but, finding his opposition unavailing, finally gave way and retreated
to his retirement.</p>

<p><b>259. The Gates of Janus Opened.</b> It was the custom of the
country, when war was to be undertaken, for the chief magistrate,
clad in his robes of office, with solemn pomp to open the gates of
the temple of Janus, which were kept shut as long as peace endured.
His people now urged the old king to perform that solemn
office, but he refused to do so. While they contested, Juno herself,
descending from the skies, smote the doors with irresistible force
and burst them open. Immediately the whole country was in a
flame. The people rushed from every side, breathing nothing
but war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>Turnus was recognized by all as leader; others joined as allies,
chief of whom was Mezentius, a brave and able soldier, but of detestable
cruelty. He had been the chief of one of the neighboring
cities, but his people drove him out. With him was joined his son
Lausus, a generous youth worthy of a better sire.</p>

<p><b>260. Camilla.</b> Camilla, the favorite of Diana, a huntress and
warrior after the fashion of the Amazons, came with her band of
mounted followers, including a select number of her own sex, and
ranged herself on the side of Turnus. This maiden had never
accustomed her fingers to the distaff or the
loom, but had learned to endure the toils of
war and in speed to outstrip the wind. It
seemed as if she might run over the standing
corn without crushing it, or over the surface
of the water without dipping her feet.
Camilla's history had been singular from the
beginning. Her father, Metabus, driven from
his city by civil discord, carried with him in
his flight his infant daughter. As he fled
through the woods, his enemies in hot pursuit,
he reached the bank of the river Amasenus,
which, swelled by rains, seemed to debar
a passage. He paused for a moment, then
decided what to do. He tied the infant to his
lance with wrappers of bark, and poising the
weapon in his upraised hand, thus addressed
Diana: "Goddess of the woods! I consecrate this maid to thee";
then hurled the weapon with its burden to the opposite bank. The
spear flew across the roaring water. His pursuers were already
upon him, but he plunged into the river, and swam across, and
found the spear with the infant safe on the other side. Thenceforth
he lived among the shepherds and brought up his daughter
in woodland arts. While a child she was taught to use the bow
and throw the javelin. With her sling she could bring down the
crane or the wild swan. Her dress was a tiger's skin. Many
mothers sought her for a daughter-in-law, but she continued faithful
to Diana and repelled the thought of marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p><b>261. Alliance with Evander.</b> Such were the formidable allies
that ranged themselves against &AElig;neas. It was night, and he lay
stretched in sleep on the bank of the river under the open heavens.
The god of the stream, Father Tiber, seemed to raise his head
above the willows and to say: "O goddess-born, destined possessor
of the Latin realms, this is the promised land; here is to be thy
home, here shall terminate the hostility of the heavenly powers, if
only thou faithfully persevere. There are friends not far distant.
Prepare thy boats and row up my stream; I will lead thee to Evander,
the Arcadian chief. He has long been at strife with Turnus
and the Rutulians, and is prepared to become an ally of thine.
Rise! offer thy vows to Juno and deprecate her anger. When thou
hast achieved thy victory, then think of me." &AElig;neas woke and paid
immediate obedience to the friendly vision. He sacrificed to Juno,
and invoked the god of the river and all his tributary fountains to
lend their aid. Then for the first time a vessel filled with armed
warriors floated on the stream of the Tiber. The river smoothed
its waves and bade its current flow gently, while, impelled by the
vigorous strokes of the rowers, the vessel shot rapidly up the stream.</p>

<p>About the middle of the day they came in sight of the scattered
buildings of the infant town where in after times the proud city of
Rome grew, whose glory reached the skies. By chance the old king,
Evander, was that day celebrating annual solemnities in honor of
Hercules and all the gods. Pallas, his son, and all the chiefs of
the little commonwealth stood by. When they saw the tall ship
gliding onward through the wood, they were alarmed at the sight
and rose from the tables. But Pallas forbade the solemnities to be
interrupted and, seizing a weapon, stepped forward to the river's
bank. He called aloud, demanding who the strangers were and
what their object. &AElig;neas, holding forth an olive branch, replied:
"We are Trojans, friends to you and enemies to the Rutulians.
We seek Evander and offer to join our arms with yours." Pallas,
in amaze at the sound of so great a name, invited them to land,
and when &AElig;neas touched the shore, he seized his hand and held
it long in friendly grasp. Proceeding through the wood they joined
the king and his party, and were most favorably received. Seats
were provided for them at the tables, and the repast proceeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p><b>262. The Site of Future Rome.</b> When the solemnities were
ended, all moved towards the city. The king, bending with age,
walked between his son and &AElig;neas, taking the arm of one or the
other of them, and with much variety of pleasing talk shortening
the way. &AElig;neas with delight looked and listened, observing all
the beauties of the scene and learning much of heroes renowned
in ancient times. Evander said: "These extensive groves were
once inhabited by fauns and nymphs, and a rude race of men who
sprang from the trees themselves and had neither laws nor social
culture. They knew not how to yoke the cattle, nor raise a harvest,
nor provide from present abundance for future want, but browsed
like beasts upon the leafy boughs or fed voraciously on their hunted
prey. Such were they when Saturn, expelled from Olympus by
his sons, came among them and drew together the fierce savages,
formed them into society, and gave them laws. Such peace and
plenty ensued that men ever since have called his reign the Golden
Age; but by degrees far other times succeeded, and the thirst of
gold and the thirst of blood prevailed. The land was a prey to successive
tyrants till fortune and resistless destiny brought me hither,
an exile from my native land, Arcadia."</p>

<p>Having thus said, he showed him the Tarpeian rock, and the
rude spot, then overgrown with bushes, where in after times the
Capitol was to rise in all its magnificence. He next pointed to
some dismantled walls and said, "Here stood Janiculum, built by
Janus, and there Saturnia, the town of Saturn." Such discourse
brought them to the cottage of Evander, whence they saw the lowing
herds roaming over the plain where soon should stand the
proud and stately Forum. They entered, and a couch, well stuffed
with leaves and covered with the skin of a Libyan bear, was spread
for &AElig;neas.</p>

<p>Next morning, awakened by the dawn and the shrill song of birds
beneath the eaves of his low mansion, old Evander rose. Clad in a
tunic, and a panther's skin thrown over his shoulders, with sandals
on his feet and his good sword girded to his side, he went forth to
seek his guest. Two mastiffs followed him,&mdash;his whole retinue and
bodyguard. He found the hero attended by his faithful Achates,
and Pallas soon joining them, the old king spoke thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>"Illustrious Trojan, it is but little we can do in so great a cause.
Our state is feeble, hemmed in on one side by the river, on the
other by the Rutulians. But I propose to ally thee with a people
numerous and rich, to whom fate has brought thee at the propitious
moment. The Etruscans hold the country beyond the river.
Mezentius was their king, a monster of cruelty, who invented unheard-of
torments to gratify his vengeance. He would fasten the
dead to the living, hand to hand and face to face, and leave the
wretched victims to die in that dreadful embrace. At length people
cast him out, him and his house. They burned his palace,
and slew his friends. He escaped and took refuge with Turnus,
who protects him with arms. The Etruscans demand that he shall
be given up to deserved punishment, and would ere now have attempted
to enforce their demand; but their priests restrain them,
telling them that it is the will of heaven that no native of the
land shall guide them to victory and that their destined leader
must come from across the sea. They have offered the crown to
me, but I am too old to undertake such great affairs, and my son is
native-born, which precludes him from the choice. Thou, equally
by birth and time of life and fame in arms pointed out by the
gods, hast but to appear to be hailed at once as their leader.
With thee I will join Pallas, my son, my only hope and comfort.
Under thee he shall learn the art of war and strive to emulate
thy great exploits."</p>

<p>Then the king ordered horses to be furnished for the Trojan
chiefs, and &AElig;neas, with a chosen band of followers and Pallas
accompanying, mounted and took the way to the Etruscan city,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
having sent back the rest of his party in the ships. &AElig;neas and
his band safely arrived at the Etruscan camp and were received
with open arms by Tarchon and his countrymen.</p>

<p><b>263. Turnus attacks the Trojan Camp.</b> In the meanwhile Turnus
had collected his bands and made all necessary preparations
for the war. Juno sent Iris to him with a message inciting him to
take advantage of the absence of &AElig;neas and surprise the Trojan
camp. Accordingly the attempt was made; but the Trojans were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>found on their guard, and having received strict orders from &AElig;neas
not to fight in his absence, they lay still in their intrenchments and
resisted all the efforts of the Rutulians to draw them into the field.
Night coming on, the army of Turnus, in high spirits at their
fancied superiority, feasted and enjoyed themselves, and finally
stretched themselves on the field and slept secure.</p>

<p><b>264. Nisus and Euryalus.</b> In the camp of the Trojans things
were far otherwise. There all was watchfulness and anxiety, and
impatience for &AElig;neas' return. Nisus stood guard at the entrance
of the camp, and Euryalus, a youth distinguished above all in the
army for graces of person and fine qualities, was with him. These
two were friends and brothers in arms. Nisus said to his friend:
"Dost thou perceive what confidence and carelessness the enemy
display? Their lights are few and dim, and the men seem all
oppressed with wine or sleep. Thou knowest how anxiously our
chiefs wish to send to &AElig;neas and to get intelligence from him.
Now I am strongly moved to make my way through the enemy's
camp and to go in search of our chief. If I succeed, the glory
of the deed will be reward enough for me, and if they judge the
service deserves anything more, let them pay it thee."</p>

<p>Euryalus, all on fire with the love of adventure, replied: "Wouldst
thou then, Nisus, refuse to share thy enterprise with me? And
shall I let thee go into such danger alone? Not so my brave father
brought me up, nor so have I planned for myself when I joined
the standard of &AElig;neas and resolved to hold my life cheap in comparison
with honor." Nisus replied: "I doubt it not, my friend;
but thou knowest the uncertain event of such an undertaking, and
whatever may happen to me, I wish thee to be safe. Thou art
younger than I and hast more of life in prospect. Nor can I be
the cause of such grief to thy mother, who has chosen to be here
in the camp with thee rather than stay and live in peace with the
other matrons in Acestes' city." Euryalus replied, "Say no more.
In vain dost thou seek arguments to dissuade me. I am fixed in
the resolution to go with thee. Let us lose no time." They called
the guard and, committing the watch to them, sought the general's
tent. They found the chief officers in consultation, deliberating
how they should send notice to &AElig;neas of their situation. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
offer of the two friends was gladly accepted, themselves loaded
with praises and promised the most liberal rewards in case of
success. Iulus especially addressed Euryalus, assuring him of his
lasting friendship. Euryalus replied: "I have but one boon to ask.
My aged mother is with me in the camp. For me she left the
Trojan soil and would not stay behind with the other matrons at
the city of Acestes. I go now without taking leave of her. I could
not bear her tears nor set at naught her entreaties. But do thou, I
beseech thee, comfort her in her distress. Promise me that and
I shall go more boldly into whatever dangers may present themselves."
Iulus and the other chiefs were moved to tears and promised
to do all his request. "Thy mother shall be mine," said Iulus,
"and all that I have promised thee shall be made good to her, if
thou dost not return to receive it."</p>

<p>The two friends left the camp and plunged at once into the
midst of the enemy. They found no watch, no sentinels posted,
but, all about, the sleeping soldiers strewn on the grass and among
the wagons. The laws of war at that early day did not forbid a
brave man to slay a sleeping foe, and the two Trojans slew, as they
passed, such of the enemy as they could without exciting alarm.
In one tent Euryalus made prize of a helmet brilliant with gold
and plumes. They had passed through the enemy's ranks without
being discovered, but now suddenly appeared a troop directly in
front of them, which, under Volscens, their leader, were approaching
the camp. The glittering helmet of Euryalus caught their
attention, and Volscens hailed the two and demanded who and
whence they were. They made no answer, but plunged into the
wood. The horsemen scattered in all directions to intercept their
flight. Nisus had eluded pursuit and was out of danger, but, since
Euryalus was missing, he turned back to seek him. He again entered
the wood and soon came within sound of voices. Looking
through the thicket he saw the whole band surrounding Euryalus
with noisy questions. What should he do; how extricate the youth;
or would it be better to die with him?</p>

<p>Raising his eyes to the moon which now shone clear, he said,
"Goddess, favor my effort!" and, aiming his javelin at one of the
leaders of the troop, struck him in the back and stretched him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
on the plain with a deathblow. In the midst of their amazement
another weapon flew, and another of the party fell dead. Volscens,
the leader, ignorant whence the darts came, rushed sword in hand
upon Euryalus. "Thou shalt pay the penalty of both," he said,
and would have plunged the sword into his bosom, when Nisus,
who from his concealment saw the peril of his friend, rushed forward
exclaiming, "'T was I! 't was I! Turn your swords against
me, Rutulians. I did it; he only followed me as a friend." While
he spoke the sword fell and pierced the comely bosom of Euryalus.
His head fell over on his shoulder, like a flower cut down by the
plow. Nisus rushed upon Volscens and plunged his sword into
his body, and was himself slain on the instant by numberless blows.</p>

<p><b>265. The Death of Mezentius.</b> &AElig;neas, with his Etrurian allies,
arrived on the scene of action in time to rescue his beleaguered
camp; and now the two armies being nearly equal in strength,
the war began in good earnest. We cannot find space for all the
details, but must simply record the fate of the principal characters.
The tyrant Mezentius, finding himself engaged against his revolted
subjects, raged like a wild beast. He slew all who dared withstand
him, and put the multitude to flight wherever he appeared. At
last he encountered &AElig;neas, and the armies stood still to see the
issue. Mezentius threw his spear, which, striking &AElig;neas' shield,
glanced off and hit Antores,&mdash;a Grecian by birth who had left
Argos, his native city, and followed Evander into Italy. The poet
says of him, with simple pathos which has made the words proverbial,
"He fell, unhappy, by a wound intended for another,
looked up to the skies, and, dying, remembered sweet Argos."<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
&AElig;neas now in turn hurled his lance. It pierced the shield of
Mezentius and wounded him in the thigh. Lausus, his son, could
not bear the sight, but rushed forward and interposed himself,
while the followers pressed round Mezentius and bore him away.
&AElig;neas held his sword suspended over Lausus and delayed to
strike, but the furious youth pressed on, and he was compelled to
deal the fatal blow. Lausus fell, and &AElig;neas bent over him in pity.
"Hapless youth," he said, "what can I do for thee worthy of thy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>praise? Keep those arms in which thou gloriest, and fear not but
that thy body shall be restored to thy friends and have due funeral
honors." So saying, he called the timid followers and delivered
the body into their hands.</p>

<p>Mezentius meanwhile had been borne to the riverside, and had
washed his wound. Soon the news reached him of Lausus' death,
and rage and despair supplied the place of strength. He mounted
his horse and dashed into the thickest of the fight, seeking &AElig;neas.
Having found him, he rode round him in a circle, throwing one
javelin after another, while &AElig;neas stood fenced with his shield,
turning every way to meet them. At last after Mezentius had
three times made the circuit, &AElig;neas threw his lance directly at
the horse's head. The animal fell with pierced temples, while a
shout from both armies rent the skies. Mezentius asked no mercy,
but only that his body might be spared the insults of his revolted
subjects and be buried in the same grave with his son. He received
the fatal stroke not unprepared, and poured out his life and
his blood together.</p>

<p><b>266. The Deaths of Pallas and Camilla.</b> While these things
were doing in one part of the field, in another Turnus encountered
the youthful Pallas. The contest between champions so unequally
matched could not be doubtful. Pallas bore himself bravely, but
fell by the lance of Turnus. The victor almost relented when he saw
the brave youth lying dead at his feet, and spared to use the privilege
of a conqueror in despoiling him of his arms. The belt only,
adorned with studs and carvings of gold, he took and clasped round
his own body. The rest he remitted to the friends of the slain.</p>

<p>After the battle there was a cessation of arms for some days to
allow both armies to bury their dead. In this interval &AElig;neas challenged
Turnus to decide the contest by single combat, but Turnus
evaded the challenge. Another battle ensued, in which Camilla,
the virgin warrior, was chiefly conspicuous. Her deeds of valor
surpassed those of the bravest warriors, and many Trojans and
Etruscans fell pierced with her darts or struck down by her battle-ax.
At last an Etruscan named Aruns, who had watched her
long, seeking for some advantage, observed her pursuing an enemy
whose splendid armor offered a tempting prize. Intent on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
chase she observed not her danger, and the javelin of Aruns struck
her and inflicted a fatal wound. She fell and breathed her last in
the arms of her attendant maidens. But Diana, who beheld her fate,
suffered not her slaughter to be unavenged. Aruns, as he stole
away glad but frightened, was struck by a secret arrow, launched
by one of the nymphs of Diana's train, and he died ignobly and
unknown.</p>

<p><b>267. The Final Conflict.</b> At length the final conflict took place
between &AElig;neas and Turnus. Turnus had avoided the contest as
long as he could; but at last, impelled by the ill success of his
arms and by the murmurs of his followers, he braced himself to
the conflict. The outcome could not be doubtful. On the side of
&AElig;neas were the expressed decree of destiny, the aid of his goddess-mother
in every emergency, and impenetrable armor fabricated
by Vulcan, at her request, for her son. Turnus, on the other hand,
was deserted by his celestial allies, Juno having been expressly forbidden
by Jupiter to assist him any longer. Turnus threw his lance,
but it recoiled harmless from the shield of &AElig;neas. The Trojan
hero then threw his, which, penetrating the shield of Turnus,
pierced his thigh. Then Turnus' fortitude forsook him, and he
begged for mercy; &AElig;neas, indeed, would have spared his opponent's
life, but at the instant his eye fell on the belt of Pallas,
which Turnus had taken from the slaughtered youth. Instantly
his rage revived, and exclaiming, "Pallas immolates thee with this
blow," he thrust him through with his sword.</p>

<p>Here the poem of the &AElig;neid closes, and we are left to infer
that &AElig;neas, having triumphed over his foes, obtained Lavinia for
his bride. Tradition adds that he founded a city and called it
Lavinium, after her name. His son Iulus founded Alba Longa,
which became the birthplace of Romulus and Remus and the cradle
of Rome.</p>

<p><b>268. The Creation.</b> According to the Eddas there was once no
heaven above nor earth beneath, but only a bottomless deep, Ginungagap,
and a world of mist, Niflheim, in which sprang a fountain.
Twelve rivers issued from this fountain, Vergelmir, and
when they had flowed far from their source, they froze into ice, and
one layer accumulating over another, the great deep was filled up.</p>

<p>Southward from the world of mist was the world of light, Muspelheim.
From this proceeded a warm wind upon the ice and
melted it. The vapors rose in the air and formed clouds, from
which sprang Ymir, the rime-cold giant and his progeny, and the
cow Audhumbla, whose milk afforded nourishment and food to
the giant. The cow got nourishment by licking the hoar frost and
salt from the ice. While she was one day licking the salt stones
there appeared at first the hair of some being, on the second day
his whole head, and on the third the entire form endowed with
beauty, agility, and power. This new being was a god, Bori, from
whom and his wife, a daughter of the giant race, sprang Bor, the
father of Odin, Vili, and Ve. These three slew the giant Ymir,
and out of his body formed the earth, of his blood the seas, of his
bones the mountains, of his hair the trees, of his skull the heavens,
and of his brain clouds, charged with hail and snow. Of Ymir's
eyebrows the gods built a fence around the Midgard or mid-earth
between Niflheim and Muspelheim, destined to become the abode
of man.</p>

<p>Odin then regulated the periods of day and night and the
seasons by placing in the heavens the sun and moon, and appointing
to them their respective courses. As soon as the sun began
to shed its rays upon the earth, it caused the vegetable world to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>bud and sprout. Shortly after the gods (the Anse-race, Anses,
&AElig;sir, or Asa-folk) had created the world, they walked by the side
of the sea, pleased with their new work, but found that it was still
incomplete, for it was without human beings. They therefore took
an ashen spar and made a man out of it; woman they made out
of a piece of elm; and they called the man Ask and the woman
Embla. Odin then gave them life and soul, Vili reason and motion,
and Ve bestowed upon them the senses, expressive features, and
speech. Midgard was given them as their residence, and they
became the progenitors of the human race.</p>

<p><b>269. Yggdrasil.</b> The mighty ash tree, Yggdrasil, was supposed
to support the whole universe. It sprang from the body of Ymir,
and had three immense roots, extending one into Midgard (the
dwelling of mortals), another into J&ouml;tunheim (the abode of the
giants), and the third below Niflheim, into the region of Death.
By the side of each of these roots is a spring, from which it is
watered. The root that extends into Midgard is carefully tended
by the three Norns,&mdash;goddesses who are regarded as the dispensers
of fate. They are Urd (the past), Verdandi (the present),
Skuld (the future). The spring at the J&ouml;tunheim side is Mimir's
well, in which wisdom and wit lie hidden, but that below Niflheim
refreshes also the dark dragon of despair, Nidhogg (the back-biter),
which perpetually gnaws at the root. Four harts run across the
branches of the tree and nip the buds; they represent the four
winds. Under the tree lies Ymir, and when he tries to shake off its
weight the earth quakes. The boughs overshadow the earth, and
the top rises into Asgard in the zenith.</p>

<p><b>270. Odin and his Valhalla.</b> To Asgard, the abode of the gods,
access is gained only by crossing the bridge, Bifrost (the rainbow).
Asgard&mdash;Gladsheim for the gods, Vingolf for the goddesses&mdash;consists
of golden and silver palaces; but the most beautiful of these
is Valhalla, the great hall of Odin. When seated on his throne he
overlooks heaven and earth. Beside him sits <i>Frigga</i> (or <i>Fricka</i>),
his wife, who knows all things. Upon his shoulders are the ravens,
Hugin and Munin,&mdash;Thought and Memory,&mdash;who fly every day
over the whole world, and on their return report to him what they
have seen and heard. At his feet lie his two wolves, Geri and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
Freki, to whom Odin gives the meat that is set before him, for he
himself stands in no need of food. Mead is for him both food and
drink. He invented the Runic characters; the decrees of fate, inscribed
therein, it is the business of the Norns to engrave upon a
metal shield. From Odin's name, spelt Woden, as it sometimes
is, comes our English word, Wednesday.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 274px;">
<img src="images/image203.jpg" width="274" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 186. Valkyrie bearing a Hero to Valhalla</span></p>

<p>From the painting by Dielitz</p></div>
</div>

<p>Odin is frequently called Alfadur (Allfather), but this name is
sometimes used in a way that shows that the Scandinavians had an
idea of a deity superior to Odin, uncreated and eternal. In Valhalla
Odin feasts with his chosen heroes, all those who have fallen bravely
in battle, for all who die a peaceful death are excluded. The flesh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
of the boar Serimnir is served up to them and is abundant for all.
For although this boar is cooked every morning, he becomes whole
again every night. For drink the heroes are supplied abundantly
with mead from the she-goat Heidrun. When the heroes are not
feasting, they amuse themselves with fighting. Every day they ride
out into the court or field and fight until they cut each other in
pieces. This is their pastime; but when mealtime comes, they
recover from their wounds and return to feast in Valhalla.</p>

<p><b>271. The Valkyries.</b> The Valkyries are warlike virgins, mounted
upon horses and armed with helmets, shields, and spears. Odin is
desirous of gathering many heroes in Valhalla that he may gloriously
meet the giants in the day of the final contest; he therefore
sends to every battle field for the bravest of those who shall be
slain. The Valkyries, Choosers of the Slain, are his messengers.
Later they are called his daughters. When they ride forth on
their errand, their armor sheds a weird flickering light over the
northern skies, making what men call the Aurora Borealis.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p><b>272. Thor and the Other Gods.</b> Of the following, <i>Thor</i>, <i>Vidar</i>,
<i>Bragi</i>, <i>Balder</i>, and <i>H&ouml;der</i> are sons of Odin. <i>Thor</i>, the thunderer,
Odin's eldest son, is the strongest of gods and men, and possesses
three precious things. The first is a hammer, which both the Frost
and the Mountain giants (Hrim-thursar and Berg-risar) know to
their cost, when they see it hurled against them in the air, for it
has split many a skull of their fathers and kindred. When thrown,
it returns to his hand of its own accord. The second rare thing
he possesses is the belt of strength. When he girds it about him
his divine might is doubled. The third is his iron gloves, which
he puts on whenever he would use his mallet efficiently. From
Thor's name is derived our word Thursday.</p>

<p><i>Vidar</i> comes next in strength to Thor.</p>

<p><i>Bragi</i> is the god of poetry, and his song records the deeds of
warriors. His wife, <i>Iduna</i>, keeps in a box the apples which the
gods, when they feel old age approaching, have only to taste of
to become young again.</p>

<p><i>Balder</i>, dearest of the Anses, is the god of sunlight, spring, and
gladness. <i>H&ouml;der</i>, his opposite, is the blind god of winter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>
<p>Of other gods, <i>Freyr</i> presides over rain and sunshine and all the
fruits of the earth. His sister <i>Freya</i> (Freia) is the most propitious of
the goddesses. She loves music, spring, and flowers, and the fairies
of Elfheim. She is the goddess of love. Her day is Friday.</p>

<p><i>Tyr</i> (<i>Ziu</i> or <i>Tiw</i>), from whose name is derived our Tuesday,
is the wrestler among the gods; and pre&euml;minently the "god of
battles."</p>

<p><i>Heimdall</i> is the watchman of the gods, and is therefore placed
on the borders of heaven to prevent the giants from forcing their
way over the bridge Bifrost. He requires less sleep than a bird,
and sees by night as well as by day a hundred miles around him.
So acute is his ear that no sound escapes him, for he can even
hear the grass grow,&mdash;and the wool on a sheep's back.</p>

<p><b>273. Loki and his Progeny.</b> Loki (or Loge) is described as the
calumniator of the gods and the contriver of all fraud and mischief.
He is the son of Farbauti, the Charon of Norse mythology. He is
handsome and well made, but of fickle mood and evil disposition.
Although of the demon race, he forced himself into the company
of the gods, and seemed to take pleasure in bringing them into
difficulties, and in extricating them out of the danger by his
cunning, wit, and skill. Loki has three children. The first is the
wolf <i>Fenris</i>, the second the <i>Midgard Serpent</i>, the third <i>Hela</i>
(Death). The gods were not ignorant that these monsters were
maturing and that they would one day bring much evil upon gods
and men. So Odin deemed it advisable to send one to bring them
to him. When they came he threw the serpent in that deep ocean
by which the earth is surrounded. But the monster has grown to
such an enormous size that, holding his tail in his mouth, he encircles
the whole earth. Hela he hurled below Niflheim and gave
her power over nine worlds or regions, in which she distributes
those who are sent to her,&mdash;that is, all who die of sickness or old
age. Her hall is called Eliudnir, or Sleet-den. Hunger is her table,
Starvation her knife, Delay her man, Slowness her maid, Pale Woe
her door, Stumbling-stone her threshold, Care her bed; and Falling-peril
forms the hangings of her apartments. She may easily
be recognized, for her body is half flesh color and half blue, and
she presents a stern and forbidding countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>The wolf Fenris gave the gods a great deal of trouble before
they succeeded in chaining him. He broke the strongest fetters
as if they were made of cobwebs. Finally the gods sent a messenger
to the mountain spirits, who made for them the chain
called Gleipnir. It is fashioned of six things,&mdash;the noise made
by the footfall of a cat, the beards of women, the roots of stones,
the breath of fishes, the nerves (sensibilities) of bears, and the
spittle of birds. When finished it was as smooth and soft as a
silken string. But when the gods asked the wolf to suffer himself
to be bound with this apparently slight ribbon, he suspected their
design, fearing that it was made by enchantment. He therefore
consented to be bound with it only upon condition that one of the
gods put his hand in his (Fenris') mouth as a pledge that the band
was to be removed again. Tyr alone had courage enough to do
this. But when the wolf found that he could not break his fetters
and that the gods would not release him, he bit off Tyr's hand.
Tyr, consequently, has ever since remained one-handed.</p>

<p><b>274. The Conflict with the Mountain Giants.</b> When the gods
were constructing their abodes and had already finished Midgard
and Valhalla, a certain artificer came and offered to build them a
residence so well fortified that they should be perfectly safe from
the incursions of the Frost giants and the giants of the mountains.
But he demanded for his reward the goddess Freya, together with
the sun and moon. The gods yielded to the terms, provided that
the artificer would finish the whole work without any one's assistance,
and all within the space of one winter. But if anything
remained unfinished on the first day of summer, he should forfeit
the recompense agreed on. On being told these terms, the artificer
stipulated that he be allowed the use of his horse Svadilfari, and
this request, by the advice of Loki, was conceded. He accordingly
set to work on the first day of winter, and during the night let his
horse draw stone for the building. The enormous size of the stones
struck the gods with astonishment, and they saw clearly that the
horse did one half more of the toilsome work than his master.
Their bargain, however, had been concluded and confirmed by
solemn oaths, for without these precautions a giant would not have
thought himself safe among the gods,&mdash;still less, indeed, if Thor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
should return from the expedition he had then undertaken against
the evil demons.</p>

<p>As the winter drew to a close the building was far advanced,
and the bulwarks were sufficiently high and massive to render the
place impregnable. In short, when it wanted but three days to
summer, the only part that remained to be finished was the gateway.
Then sat the gods on their seats of justice and entered into
consultation, inquiring of one another who among them could have
advised the rest to surrender Freya, or to plunge the heavens in
darkness by permitting the giant to carry away the sun and the
moon.</p>

<p>They all agreed that no one but Loki, the author of so many
evil deeds, could have given such counsel, and that he should
be put to a cruel death unless he contrived some way to prevent
the artificer from completing his task and obtaining the stipulated
recompense. They proceeded to lay hands on Loki, who in his
fright promised upon oath that, let it cost him what it might, he
would so manage matters that the man should lose his reward.
That night when the man went with Svadilfari for building-stone,
a mare suddenly ran out of a forest and began to neigh. The
horse thereat broke loose and ran after the mare into the forest,
obliging the man also to run after his horse; thus, therefore, between
one and another the whole night was lost, so that at dawn
the work had not made the usual progress. The man, seeing that
he must fail of completing his task, resumed his own gigantic
stature, and the gods now clearly perceived that it was in reality
a mountain giant who had come amongst them. Feeling no longer
bound by their oaths, they called on Thor, who immediately ran to
their assistance and, lifting up his mallet, paid the workman his
wages, not with the sun and moon, and not even by sending him
back to J&ouml;tunheim, for with the first blow he shattered the giant's
skull to pieces and hurled him headlong into Niflheim.</p>

<p><b>275. The Recovery of Thor's Hammer.</b> Soon afterward it happened
that Thor's hammer fell into the possession of the giant
Thrym, who buried it eight fathoms deep under the rocks of
J&ouml;tunheim. Thor sent Loki to negotiate with Thrym, but he
could only prevail so far as to get the giant's promise to restore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
the weapon if Freya would consent to be his bride. Loki returned
and reported the result of his mission, but the goddess of love was
horrified at the idea of bestowing her charms on the king of the
Frost giants. In this emergency Loki persuaded Thor to dress
himself in Freya's clothes and accompany him to J&ouml;tunheim.
Thrym received his veiled bride with due courtesy, but was greatly
surprised at seeing her eat for her supper eight salmon and a
full-grown ox besides other delicacies, washing the whole down with
three tuns of mead. Loki, however, assured him that she had not
tasted anything for eight long nights, so great was her desire to
see her lover, the renowned ruler of J&ouml;tunheim. Thrym had at
last the curiosity to peep under his bride's veil, but started back in
affright, and demanded why Freya's eyeballs glistened with fire.
Loki repeated the same excuse, and the giant was satisfied. He
ordered the hammer to be brought in and laid on the maiden's lap.
Thereupon Thor threw off his disguise, grasped his redoubted
weapon, and slaughtered Thrym and all his followers.</p>

<p><b>276. Thor's Visit to J&ouml;tunheim.</b> One day Thor, with his servant
Thialfi and accompanied by Loki, set out for the giants'
country. Thialfi was of all men the swiftest of foot. He bore
Thor's wallet containing their provisions. When night came on
they found themselves in an immense forest, and searched on all
sides for a place where they might pass the night. At last they
came to a large hall, with an entrance that took the whole breadth
of one end of the building. Here they lay down to sleep, but
towards midnight were alarmed by an earthquake which shook the
whole edifice. Thor, rising up, called on his companions to seek
with him a place of safety. On the right they found an adjoining
chamber into which the others entered, but Thor remained at the
doorway with his mallet in his hand, prepared to defend himself
whatever might happen. A terrible groaning was heard during the
night, and at dawn of day Thor went out and found lying near
him a huge giant, still snoring in the way that had alarmed them.
For once Thor was afraid to use his mallet, and as the giant soon
waked up, Thor contented himself with simply asking his name.</p>

<p>"My name is Skrymir," said the giant, "but I need not ask
thy name, for I know that thou art the god Thor. But what has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
become of my glove?" Thor then perceived that what they had
taken overnight for a hall was the giant's glove, and the chamber
where his two companions had sought refuge was the thumb.
Skrymir then proposed that they should travel in company, and
Thor consenting, they sat down to eat their breakfast. When
they had done, Skrymir packed all the provisions into one wallet,
threw it over his shoulder, and strode on before them, taking such
tremendous strides that they were hard put to it to keep up with
him. So they traveled the whole day, and at dusk Skrymir chose a
place for them to pass the night in under a large oak tree. Skrymir
then told them he would lie down to sleep. "But take ye the
wallet," he added, "and prepare your supper."</p>

<p>Skrymir soon fell asleep and began to snore strongly, but when
Thor tried to open the wallet, he found the giant had tied it up so
tight he could not untie a single knot. At last Thor became wroth,
and grasping his mallet with both hands, he struck a furious blow
on the giant's head. Skrymir, awakening, merely asked whether a
leaf had not fallen on his head, and whether they had supped and
were ready to go to sleep. Thor answered that they were just going
to sleep, and so saying went and laid himself down under another
tree. But sleep came not that night to Thor, and when Skrymir
snored again so loud that the forest re&euml;choed with the noise, he
arose, and, grasping his mallet, launched it with such force at the
giant's skull that it made a deep dint in it. Skrymir, awakening,
cried out: "What's the matter? Are there any birds perched on
this tree? I felt some moss from the branches fall on my head.
How fares it with thee, Thor?" But Thor went away hastily, saying
that he had just then awoke, and, that as it was only midnight,
there was still time for sleep. He, however, resolved that if he
had an opportunity of striking a third blow, it should settle all
matters between them. A little before daybreak he perceived that
Skrymir was again fast asleep, and again grasping his mallet, he
dashed it with such violence that it forced its way into the giant's
skull up to the handle. But Skrymir sat up, and, stroking his
cheek, said: "An acorn fell on my head. What! Art thou awake,
Thor? Methinks it is time for us to get up and dress ourselves;
but you have not now a long way before you to the city called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
Utgard. I have heard you whispering to one another that I am
not a man of small dimensions, but if you come to Utgard, you
will see there many men much taller than I. Wherefore I advise
you, when you come there, not to make too much of yourselves;
for the followers of Utgard-Loki will not brook the boasting of
such little fellows as you are. You must take the road that leads
eastward; mine lies northward, so we must part here."</p>

<p>Hereupon he threw his wallet over his shoulders and turned
away from them into the forest, and Thor had no wish to stop
him or to ask for any more of his company.</p>

<p>Thor and his companions proceeded on their way, and towards
noon descried a city standing in the middle of a plain. It was so
lofty that they were obliged to bend their necks quite back on
their shoulders in order to see to the top of it. On arriving they
entered the city, and seeing a large palace before them with the
door wide open, they went in and found a number of men of
prodigious stature, sitting on benches in the hall. Going further,
they came before the king Utgard-Loki, whom they saluted with
great respect. The king, regarding them with a scornful smile,
said, "If I do not mistake me, that stripling yonder must be the
god Thor." Then addressing himself to Thor, he said: "Perhaps
thou mayst be more than thou appearest to be. What are the feats
that thou and thy fellows deem yourselves skilled in?&mdash;for no one
is permitted to remain here who does not, in some feat or other,
excel all other men."</p>

<p>"The feat that I know," said Loki, "is to eat quicker than any
one else, and in this I am ready to give a proof against any one
here who may choose to compete with me."</p>

<p>"That will indeed be a feat, if thou performest what thou promisest,"
said Utgard-Loki, "and it shall be tried forthwith."</p>

<p>He then ordered one of his men, who was sitting at the farther
end of the bench and whose name was Logi, to come forward and
try his skill with Loki. A trough filled with meat having been set
on the hall floor, Loki placed himself at one end and Logi at the
other, and each of them began to eat as fast as he could, until they
met in the middle of the trough. But it was found that Loki had
only eaten the flesh, while his adversary had devoured both flesh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
bone, and the trough to boot. All the company therefore adjudged
that Loki was vanquished.</p>

<p>Utgard-Loki then asked what feat the young man who accompanied
Thor could perform. Thialfi answered that he would run a
race with any one who might be matched against him. The king
observed that skill in running was something to boast of, but if the
youth would win the match, he must display great agility. He then
arose and went, with all who were present, to a plain where there
was good ground for running on, and calling a young man named
Hugi, bade him run a match with Thialfi. In the first course Hugi
so much outstripped his competitor that he turned back and met
him not far from the starting-place. Then they ran a second and
a third time, but Thialfi met with no better success.</p>

<p>Utgard-Loki then asked Thor in what feats he would choose
to give proofs of that prowess for which he was so famous. Thor
answered that he would try a drinking-match with any one. Utgard-Loki
bade his cupbearer bring the large horn which his followers
were obliged to empty when they had trespassed in any way against
the law of the feast. The cupbearer having presented it to Thor,
Utgard-Loki said, "Whoever is a good drinker will empty that
horn at a single draft, though most men make two of it; but the
most puny drinker can do it in three."</p>

<p>Thor looked at the horn, which seemed of no extraordinary size,
though somewhat long; however, as he was very thirsty, he set
it to his lips and, without drawing breath, pulled as long and as
deeply as he could, that he might not be obliged to make a second
draft of it; but when he set the horn down and looked in, he could
scarcely perceive that the liquor was diminished.</p>

<p>After taking breath, Thor went to it again with all his might,
but when he took the horn from his mouth, it seemed to him that
he had drank rather less than before, although the horn could now
be carried without spilling.</p>

<p>"How now, Thor," said Utgard-Loki, "thou must not spare thyself;
if thou meanest to drain the horn at the third draft, thou
must pull deeply; and I must needs say that thou wilt not be
called so mighty a man here as thou art at home if thou showest no
greater prowess in other feats than methinks will be shown in this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<p>Thor, full of wrath, again set the horn to his lips and did his
best to empty it; but on looking in found the liquor was only a
little lower, so he resolved to make no further attempt, but gave
back the horn to the cupbearer.</p>

<p>"I now see plainly," said Utgard-Loki, "that thou art not quite
so stout as we thought thee; but wilt thou try any other feat?&mdash;though
methinks thou art not likely to bear any prize away with
thee hence."</p>

<p>"What new trial hast thou to propose?" said Thor.</p>

<p>"We have a very trifling game here," answered Utgard-Loki,
"in which we exercise none but children. It consists in merely
lifting my cat from the ground; nor should I have dared to mention
such a feat to the great Thor if I had not already observed
that thou art by no means what we took thee for."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking a large gray cat sprang on the hall floor.
Thor put his hand under the cat's belly and did his utmost to raise
him from the floor, but the cat, bending his back, had, notwithstanding
all Thor's efforts, only one of his feet lifted up, seeing
which Thor made no further attempt.</p>

<p>"This trial has turned out," said Utgard-Loki, "just as I imagined
it would. The cat is large, but Thor is little in comparison to
our men."</p>

<p>"Little as ye call me," answered Thor, "let me see who among
you will come hither now that I am in wrath and wrestle with me."</p>

<p>"I see no one here," said Utgard-Loki, looking at the men
sitting on the benches, "who would not think it beneath him to
wrestle with thee; let somebody, however, call hither that old
crone, my nurse Elli, and let Thor wrestle with her if he will.
She has thrown to the ground many a man not less strong than
this Thor is."</p>

<p>A toothless old woman then entered the hall, and was told by
Utgard-Loki to take hold of Thor. The tale is shortly told. The
more Thor tightened his hold on the crone the firmer she stood.
At length, after a very violent struggle, Thor began to lose his
footing, and was finally brought down upon one knee. Utgard-Loki
then told them to desist, adding that Thor had now no
occasion to ask any one else in the hall to wrestle with him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
it was also getting late; so he showed Thor and his companions
to their seats, and they passed the night there in good cheer.</p>

<p>The next morning, at break of day, Thor and his companions
dressed themselves and prepared for their departure. Utgard-Loki
ordered a table to be set for them, on which there was no lack of
victuals or drink. After the repast Utgard-Loki led them to the
gate of the city, and on parting asked Thor how he thought his
journey had turned out and whether he had met with any men
stronger than himself. Thor told him that he could not deny but that
he had brought great shame on himself. "And what grieves me
most," he added, "is that ye will call me a person of little worth."</p>

<p>"Nay," said Utgard-Loki, "it behooves me to tell thee the
truth, now thou art out of the city, which so long as I live and
have my way thou shalt never enter again. And, by my troth, had
I known beforehand that thou hadst so much strength in thee, and
wouldst have brought me so near to a great mishap I would not
have suffered thee to enter this time. Know then that I have all
along deceived thee by my illusions; first in the forest, where I
tied up the wallet with iron wire so that thou couldst not untie it.
After this thou gavest me three blows with thy mallet; the first,
though the least, would have ended my days had it fallen on me,
but I slipped aside and thy blows fell on the mountain, where thou
wilt find three glens, one of them remarkably deep. These are the
dints made by thy mallet. I have made use of similar illusions in
the contests ye have had with my followers. In the first, Loki, like
hunger itself, devoured all that was set before him, but Logi was
in reality nothing else than Fire, and therefore consumed not only
the meat but the trough which held it. Hugi, with whom Thialfi
contended in running, was Thought, and it was impossible for
Thialfi to keep pace with that. When thou, in thy turn, didst attempt
to empty the horn, thou didst perform, by my troth, a deed
so marvelous that had I not seen it myself I should never have
believed it. For one end of that horn reached the sea, which thou
wast not aware of, but when thou comest to the shore thou wilt
perceive how much the sea has sunk by thy drafts. Thou didst
perform a feat no less wonderful by lifting up the cat, and to tell
thee the truth, when we saw that one of his paws was off the floor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
we were all of us terror-stricken, for what thou tookest for a cat
was in reality the Midgard serpent that encompasseth the earth,
and he was so stretched by thee that he was barely long enough to
inclose it between his head and tail. Thy wrestling with Elli was
also a most astonishing feat, for there was never yet a man, nor
ever will be, whom Old Age, for such in fact was Elli, will not
sooner or later lay low. But now, as we are going to part, let me
tell thee that it will be better for both of us if thou never come
near me again, for shouldst thou do so, I shall again defend myself
by other illusions, so that thou wilt only lose thy labor and get no
fame from the contest with me."</p>

<p>On hearing these words Thor, in a rage, laid hold of his mallet
and would have launched it at him, but Utgard-Loki had disappeared,
and when Thor would have returned to the city to destroy
it, he found nothing around him but a verdant plain.</p>

<p><b>277. The Sword of Freyr.</b> Freyr also possessed a wonderful
weapon, a sword which would of itself spread a field with carnage
whenever the owner desired it. Freyr parted with this sword, but
was less fortunate than Thor and never recovered it. It happened
in this way: Freyr once mounted Odin's throne, from whence one
can see over the whole universe, and looking round, saw far off in
the giant's kingdom a beautiful maid, at the sight of whom he was
struck with sudden sadness, insomuch that from that moment he
could neither sleep nor drink nor speak. At last Skirnir, his
messenger, drew his secret from him, and undertook to get him
the maiden for his bride, if he would give him his sword as a
reward. Freyr consented and gave him the sword, and Skirnir
set off on his journey and obtained the maiden's promise that
within nine nights she would come to a certain place and there
wed Freyr. Skirnir having reported the success of his errand,
Freyr exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Long is one night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long are two nights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how shall I hold out three?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shorter hath seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A month to me oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than of this longing time the half."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>
<p>So Freyr obtained Gerda, the most beautiful of all women, for
his wife, but he lost his sword.</p>

<p><b>278. The Death of Balder.</b> Balder the Good, having been tormented
with terrible dreams indicating that his life was in peril,
told them to the assembled gods, who resolved to conjure all things
to avert from him the threatened danger. Then Frigga, the wife
of Odin, exacted an oath from fire and water, from iron and all
other metals, from stones, trees, diseases, beasts, birds, poisons,
and creeping things, that none of them would do any harm to
Balder. Odin, not satisfied with all this, and feeling alarmed for the
fate of his son, determined to consult the prophetess Angerbode, a
giantess, mother of Fenris, Hela, and the Midgard serpent. She
was dead, and Odin was forced to seek her in Hela's dominions.</p>

<p>But the other gods, feeling that what Frigga had done was quite
sufficient, amused themselves with using Balder as a mark, some
hurling darts at him, some stones, while others hewed at him with
their swords and battle-axes, for do what they would, none of them
could harm him. And this became a favorite pastime with them,
and was regarded as an honor shown to Balder. But when Loki
beheld the scene, he was sorely vexed that Balder was not hurt.
Assuming, therefore, the shape of a woman, he went to Fensalir,
the mansion of Frigga. That goddess, when she saw the pretended
woman, inquired of her if she knew what the gods were doing at
their meetings. She replied that they were throwing darts and
stones at Balder, without being able to hurt him. "Ay," said Frigga,
"neither stones, nor sticks, nor anything else can hurt Balder, for
I have exacted an oath from all of them." "What," exclaimed the
woman, "have all things sworn to spare Balder?" "All things,"
replied Frigga, "except one little shrub that grows on the eastern
side of Valhalla and is called Mistletoe, which I thought too young
and feeble to crave an oath from."</p>

<p>As soon as Loki heard this he went away and, resuming his
natural shape, cut off the mistletoe and repaired to the place where
the gods were assembled. There he found H&ouml;der standing apart,
without partaking of the sports on account of his blindness, and
going up to him said, "Why dost thou not also throw something
at Balder?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I am blind," answered H&ouml;der, "and see not where
Balder is, and have, moreover, nothing to throw."</p>

<p>"Come, then," said Loki, "do like the rest and show honor to
Balder by throwing this twig at him, and I will direct thy arm
toward the place where he stands."</p>

<p>H&ouml;der then took the mistletoe and, under the guidance of Loki,
darted it at Balder, who, pierced through and through, fell down
lifeless. Never was there witnessed, either among gods or men,
a more atrocious deed.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So on the floor lay Balder dead; and round<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i2">And all the gods and all the heroes came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood round Balder on the bloody floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping and wailing; and Valhalla rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to its golden roof with sobs and cries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the tables stood the untasted meats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the horns and gold-rimmed skulls the wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now would night have fall'n and found them yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wailing; but otherwise was Odin's will.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He bade them not to spend themselves in unavailing grief, for
Balder, though the brightest god of heaven and best beloved, had
but met the doom ordained at his birth by the Norns. Rather let
the funeral pile be prepared, and let vengeance on Loki be left to
Odin himself. So speaking, Odin mounted his horse Sleipnir and
rode away to Lidskialf, and the gods in Valhalla returned to the
feast:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And before each the cooks, who served them, placed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New messes of the boar Serimnir's flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Valkyries crowned their horns with mead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they, with pent-up hearts and tearless eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wailing no more, in silence ate and drank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While twilight fell, and sacred night came on.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>
<p>But the blind H&ouml;der, leaving the gods, went by the sea to Fensalir,
the house of Frigga, mother of the gods, to ask her what way
there might be of restoring Balder to life and heaven. Might Hela
perchance surrender Balder if H&ouml;der himself should take his place
among the shades? "Nay," replied Frigga, "no way is there but
one, that the first god thou meetest on the return to Asgard take
Sleipnir, Odin's horse, and ride o'er the bridge Bifrost where is
Heimdall's watch, past Midgard fortress, down the dark, unknown
road to Hel, and there entreat the goddess Hela that she yield
Balder back to heaven." H&ouml;der, returning cityward, met Hermod,
swiftest of the gods,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor yet could Hermod see his brother's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it grew dark; but H&ouml;der touched his arm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as a spray of honeysuckle flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brushes across a tired traveler's face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shuffles through the deep dew-moisten'd dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a May evening, in the darken'd lanes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And starts him, that he thinks a ghost went by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So H&ouml;der brush'd by Hermod's side, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Take Sleipnir, Hermod, and set forth with dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Hela's kingdom, to ask Balder back;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they shall be thy guides who have the power."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake, and brush'd soft by and disappear'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hermod gazed into the night, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Who is it utters through the dark his hest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So quickly, and will wait for no reply?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice was like the unhappy H&ouml;der's voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howbeit I will see, and do his hest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there rang note divine in that command."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So speaking, the fleet-footed Hermod came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Home, and lay down to sleep in his own house;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the gods lay down in their own homes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And H&ouml;der, too, came home distraught with grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loathing to meet, at dawn, the other gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he went in, and shut the door, and fixt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sword upright, and fell on it, and died.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But from the hill of Lidskialf Odin rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throne, from which his eye surveys the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mounted Sleipnir, and in darkness rode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Asgard. And the stars came out in heaven,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
<span class="i0">High over Asgard, to light home the king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fiercely Odin gallop'd, moved in heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swift to Asgard, to the gate he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And terribly the hoofs of Sleipnir rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the flinty floor of Asgard streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gods trembled on their golden beds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing the wrathful father coming home&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dread, for like a whirlwind Odin came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to Valhalla's gate he rode, and left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleipnir; and Sleipnir went to his own stall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in Valhalla Odin laid him down.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That night in a vision appeared Balder to Nanna his wife,
comforting her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yes, and I fain would altogether ward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death from thy head, and with the gods in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prolong thy life, though not by thee desired&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But right bars this, not only thy desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet dreary, Nanna, is the life they lead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that dim world, in Hela's moldering realm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doleful are the ghosts, the troops of dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Hela with austere control presides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For of the race of gods is no one there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save me alone, and Hela, solemn queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all the nobler souls of mortal men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On battle field have met their death, and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feast in Valhalla, in my father's hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the inglorious sort are there below&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old, the cowards, and the weak are there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men spent by sickness, or obscure decay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But even there, O Nanna, we might find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some solace in each other's look and speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering together through that gloomy world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And talking of the life we led in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we yet lived, among the other gods."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake, and straight his lineaments began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fade; and Nanna in her sleep stretch'd out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her arms towards him with a cry, but he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mournfully shook his head and disappear'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the woodman sees a little smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hang in the air, afield, and disappear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Balder faded in the night away.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And Nanna on her bed sank back; but then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frea, the mother of the gods, with stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Painless and swift, set free her airy soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which took, on Balder's track, the way below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And instantly the sacred morn appear'd.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With the morn Hermod, mounting Sleipnir, set out on his mission.
For the space of nine days and as many nights he rode
through deep glens so dark that he could not discern anything,
until he arrived at the river Gyoll, which he passed over on a
bridge covered with glittering gold. The maiden who kept the
bridge asked him his name and lineage, telling him that the day
before five bands of dead persons had ridden over the bridge, and
did not shake it as much as he alone. "But," she added, "thou
hast not death's hue on thee; why then ridest thou here on the
way to Hel?"</p>

<p>"I ride to Hel," answered Hermod, "to seek Balder. Hast thou
perchance seen him pass this way?"</p>

<p>She replied, "Balder hath ridden over Gyoll's bridge, and yonder
lieth the way he took to the abodes of death."</p>

<p>Hermod pursued his journey until he came to the barred gates
of Hel. Here he alighted, girthed his saddle tighter, and remounting
clapped both spurs to his horse, which cleared the gate by a
tremendous leap without touching it. Hermod then rode on to the
palace, where he found his brother Balder occupying the most distinguished
seat in the hall, and passed the night in his company.
The next morning he besought Hela to let Balder ride home with
him, assuring her that nothing but lamentations were to be heard
among the gods. Hela answered that it should now be tried whether
Balder was so beloved as he was said to be. "If, therefore," she
added, "all things in the world, both living and lifeless, weep for
him, then shall he return to life; but if any one thing speak against
him or refuse to weep, he shall be kept in Hel."</p>

<p>Hermod then rode back to Asgard and gave an account of all
he had heard and witnessed.</p>

<p>The gods upon this dispatched messengers throughout the world
to beg everything to weep in order that Balder might be delivered
from Hel. All things very willingly complied with this request,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
both men and every other living being, as well as earths, and stones,
and trees, and metals, just as we have all seen these things weep
when they are brought from a cold place into a hot one.</p>

<p>Then the messengers returned,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... And they rode home together, through the wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Jarnvid, which to east of Midgard lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bordering the giants, where the trees are iron;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There in the wood before a cave they came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sate in the cave's mouth a skinny hag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toothless and old; she gibes the passers-by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thok is she called, but now Lok wore her shape;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She greeted them the first, and laughed and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ye gods, good lack, is it so dull in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ye come pleasuring to Thok's iron wood?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lovers of change, ye are, fastidious sprites.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look, as in some boor's yard, a sweet-breath'd cow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose manger is stuffed full of good fresh hay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snuffs at it daintily, and stoops her head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To chew the straw, her litter at her feet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So ye grow squeamish, gods, and sniff at heaven!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She spake, but Hermod answered her and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thok, not for gibes we come; we come for tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balder is dead, and Hela holds her prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But will restore, if all things give him tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begrudge not thine! to all was Balder dear."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, with a louder laugh, the hag replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Is Balder dead? and do ye come for tears?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thok with dry eyes will weep o'er Balder's pyre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weep him all other things, if weep they will&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I weep him not! let Hela keep her prey."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She spake, and to the cavern's depth she fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mocking; and Hermod knew their toil was vain.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So was Balder prevented from returning to Asgard.</p>

<p><b>279. The Funeral of Balder.</b> The gods took up the dead body
and bore it to the seashore, where stood Balder's ship Hringham,
which passed for the largest in the world. Balder's dead body was
put on the funeral pile, on board the ship; and the body of Nanna
was burned on the same pile with her husband's. There was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>vast concourse of various kinds of people at Balder's obsequies.
First came Odin accompanied by Frigga, the Valkyries, and his
ravens; then Freyr in his car drawn by Gullinbursti, the boar;
Heimdall rode his horse Gulltopp, and Freya drove in her chariot
drawn by cats. There were also a great many Frost giants and
giants of the mountain present. Balder's horse was led to the pile
fully caparisoned, and
was consumed in the
same flames with his
master.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/image204.jpg" width="225" height="300" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 187. Loki and Siguna</span></p>

<p>From the painting by Gebhardt</p></div>
</div>

<p>But Loki did not
escape his merited
punishment. When he
saw how wroth the gods
were, he fled to the
mountain and there
built himself a hut with
four doors, so that he
could see every approaching
danger. He
invented a net to catch
the fishes, such as fishermen
have used since
his time. But Odin
found out his hiding
place and the gods assembled
to take him.
He, seeing this, changed
himself into a salmon
and lay hid among the stones of the brook. But the gods took
his net and dragged the brook, and Loki, finding he must be
caught, tried to leap over the net; but Thor caught him by the
tail, and compressed it so that salmon ever since have had that
part remarkably fine and thin. They bound him with chains and
suspended a serpent over his head, whose venom falls upon his
face drop by drop. His wife, Siguna, sits by his side and catches
the drops as they fall, in a cup; but when she carries it away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
empty it, the venom falls upon Loki, which makes him howl with
horror and writhe so that the whole earth shakes.</p>

<p><b>280. The Elves.</b> The Edda mentions another class of beings,
inferior to the gods, but still possessed of great power; these
were the Elves. The white spirits, or Elves of Light, were exceedingly
fair, more brilliant than the sun, and clad in garments of a
delicate and transparent texture. They loved the light, were kindly
disposed to mankind, and generally appeared as fair and lovely
children. Their country was called Elfheim, and was the domain
of Freyr, in whose sunlight they always sported.</p>

<p>The black elves, ugly, long-nosed dwarfs, of a dirty brown color,
appeared only at night. They avoided the sun as their most deadly
enemy, because his beams changed them immediately into stones.
Their language was the echo of solitudes, and their dwelling places
subterranean caves and clefts. They were supposed to have come
into existence as maggots produced by the decaying flesh of Ymir's
body. They were afterwards endowed by the gods with a human
form and great understanding. They were particularly distinguished
for a knowledge of the mysterious powers of nature, and for the
runes which they carved and explained. They were the most skillful
artificers of all created beings, and worked in metals and in
wood. Among their most noted works were Thor's hammer, and
the ship <i>Skidbladnir</i>, which they gave to Freyr. This vessel was so
large that it could contain all the deities with their war and household
implements, but so skillfully was it wrought that when folded
together it could be put into a side pocket.</p>

<p><b>281. Ragnarok.</b> It was a firm belief of the Northern nations
that a time would come when all the visible creation, the gods of
Valhalla and Niflheim, the inhabitants of J&ouml;tunheim, Elfheim, and
Midgard, together with their habitations, would be destroyed. The
fearful day of destruction will not however be without warning.
First will come a triple winter, during which snow will fall from
the four corners of the heavens, the frost be severe, the wind
piercing, the weather tempestuous, and the sun impart no gladness.
Three such winters will pass without being tempered by a single
summer. Three other like winters will follow, during which war
and discord will spread over the universe. The earth itself will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
afraid and begin to tremble, the sea leave its basin, the heavens
tear asunder; men will perish in great numbers, and the eagles of
the air feast upon their still quivering bodies. The wolf Fenris will
now break his bands, the Midgard serpent rise out of his bed in
the sea, and Loki, released from his bonds, will join the enemies
of the gods. Amidst the general devastation the sons of Muspelheim
will rush forth under their leader Surter, before and behind
whom are flames and burning fire. Onward they ride over Bifrost,
the rainbow bridge, which breaks under the horses' hoofs. But
they, disregarding its fall, direct their course to the battle field
called Vigrid. Thither also repair the wolf Fenris, the Midgard
serpent, Loki, with all the followers of Hela, and the Frost giants.</p>

<p>Heimdall now stands up and sounds the Giallar horn to assemble
the gods and heroes for the contest. The gods advance, led on
by Odin, who, engaging the wolf Fenris, falls a victim to the monster.
Fenris is, in turn, slain by Vidar, Odin's son. Thor wins
great renown by killing the Midgard serpent, but, recoiling, falls
dead, suffocated with the venom which the dying monster vomits
over him. Loki and Heimdall meet and fight till they both are
slain. The gods and their enemies having fallen in battle, Surter,
who has killed Freyr, darts fire and flames over the world, and the
universe is consumed. The sun grows dim, the earth sinks into
the ocean, the stars fall from heaven, and time is no more.</p>

<p>After this Alfadur (not Odin but the Almighty) will cause a new
heaven and a new earth to arise out of the sea. The new earth,
filled with abundant supplies, will produce its fruits without labor
or care. Wickedness and misery will no more be known, but the
gods and men will live happily together.</p>

<p>This twilight of the gods is aptly described in a conversation
held between Balder and Hermod, after Hermod has a second
time ridden to Hel:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the fleet-footed Hermod made reply:<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou hast then all the solace death allows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Esteem and function; and so far is well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet here thou liest, Balder, underground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rusting for ever; and the years roll on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The generations pass, the ages grow,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And bring us nearer to the final day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from the south shall march the fiery band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cross the bridge of heaven, with Lok for guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fenris at his heel with broken chain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While from the east the giant Rymer steers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ship, and the great serpent makes to land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all are marshal'd in one flaming square<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the gods, upon the plains of heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mourn thee, that thou canst not help us then."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake; but Balder answered him, and said:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Mourn not for me! Mourn, Hermod, for the gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mourn for the men on earth, the gods in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who live, and with their eyes shall see that day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day will come, when fall shall Asgard's towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Odin, and his sons, the seed of Heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what were I, to save them in that hour?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If strength might save them, could not Odin save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father, and his pride, the warrior Thor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vidar the silent, the impetuous Tyr?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, what were I, when these can nought avail?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, doubtless, when the day of battle comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the two hosts are marshal'd, and in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden-crested cock shall sound alarm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his black brother-bird from hence reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bucklers clash, and spears begin to pour&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Longing will stir within my breast, though vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not to me so grievous as, I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To other gods it were, is my enforced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Absence from fields where I could nothing aid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I am long since weary of your storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of carnage, and find, Hermod, in your life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something too much of war and broils, which make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life one perpetual fight, a bath of blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine eyes are dizzy with the arrowy hail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine ears are stunn'd with blows, and sick for calm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inactive, therefore, let me lie in gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unarm'd, inglorious; I attend the course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ages, and my late return to light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In times less alien to a spirit mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In new-recover'd seats, the happier day."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake; and the fleet Hermod thus replied:&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Brother, what seats are these, what happier day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me, that I may ponder it when gone."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the ray-crown&egrave;d Balder answered him:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Far to the south, beyond the blue, there spreads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another heaven, the boundless&mdash;no one yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath reach'd it; there hereafter shall arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second Asgard, with another name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither, when o'er this present earth and heavens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tempest of the latter days hath swept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they from sight have disappear'd and sunk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall a small remnant of the gods repair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">H&ouml;der and I shall join them from the grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There reassembling we shall see emerge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the bright ocean at our feet an earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More fresh, more verdant than the last, with fruits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Self-springing, and a seed of man preserved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who then shall live in peace, as now in war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we in heaven shall find again with joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ruin'd palaces of Odin, seats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Familiar, halls where we have supp'd of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Re&euml;nter them with wonder, never fill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our eyes with gazing, and rebuild with tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we shall tread once more the well-known plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ida, and among the grass shall find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden dice wherewith we played of yore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that shall bring to mind the former life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pastime of the gods&mdash;the wise discourse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Odin, the delights of other days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Hermod, pray that thou may'st join us then!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such for the future is my hope; meanwhile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rest the thrall of Hela, and endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, and the gloom which round me even now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thickens, and to inner gulf recalls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell, for longer speech is not allow'd."<br /></span>

<p><b>282. The Saga of the Volsungs.</b><a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Sigi, son of Odin, was a
mighty king of the Huns whom Odin loved and prospered exceedingly.
Rerir, also, the son of Sigi, was a man of valor and one who
got lordship and land unto himself; but neither Sigi nor Rerir were
to compare with <i>Volsung</i>, who ruled over Hunland after his father
Rerir went home to Odin.</p>

<p>To Volsung were born ten sons and one daughter,&mdash;Signy by
name; and of the sons <i>Sigmund</i> was the eldest and the most
valiant. And the Volsungs abode in peace till Siggeir, king of
Gothland, came wooing Signy, who, though loath to accept him,
was, by her father's desire, betrothed to him.</p>

<p>Now on the night of the wedding great fires were made in the
hall of the Volsungs, and in the midst stood Branstock, a great oak
tree, about which the hall had been built, and the limbs of the tree
spread over the roof of the hall; and round about Branstock they
sat and feasted, and sang of ancient heroes and heard the music
of the harp that went from hand to hand.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But e'en as men's hearts were hearkening some heard the thunder pass<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the cloudless noontide heaven; and some men turned about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deemed that in the doorway they heard a man laugh out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then into the Volsung dwelling a mighty man there strode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One-eyed and seeming ancient, yet bright his visage glowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cloud-blue was the hood upon him, and his kirtle gleaming-gray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the latter morning sun-dog when the storm is on the way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bill he bore on his shoulder, whose mighty ashen beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burnt bright with the flame of the sea, and the blended silver's gleam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such was the guise of his raiment as the Volsung elders had told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was borne by their fathers' fathers, and the first that warred in the wold.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So strode he to the Branstock, nor greeted any lord,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But forth from his cloudy raiment he drew a gleaming sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smote it deep in the tree-bole, and the wild hawks overhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughed 'neath the naked heaven as at last he spake and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Earls of the Goths, and Volsungs, abiders on the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo there amid the Branstock a blade of plenteous worth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The folk of the war-wand's forgers wrought never better steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since first the burg of heaven uprose for man-folk's weal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now let the man among you whose heart and hand may shift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pluck it from the oak-wood e'en take it for my gift.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then ne'er, but his own heart falter, its point and edge shall fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the night's beginning and the ending of the tale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be merry, Earls of the Goth-folk, O Volsung Sons be wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reap the battle-acre that ripening for you lies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they told me in the wild wood, I heard on the mountain-side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the shining house of heaven is wrought exceeding wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that there the Early-comers shall have abundant rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Earth grows scant of great ones, and fadeth from its best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fadeth from its midward, and groweth poor and vile:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hail to thee, King Volsung! farewell for a little while!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So sweet his speaking sounded, so wise his words did seem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That moveless all men sat there, as in a happy dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We stir not lest we waken; but there his speech had end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slowly down the hall-floor, and outward did he wend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none would cast him a question or follow on his ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they knew that the gift was Odin's, a sword for the world to praise.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then all made trial, Siggeir and his earls, and Volsung and his
people, to draw forth the sword from Branstock, but with no success,
till Sigmund, laying his hand carelessly on the precious hilt,
drew forth the naked blade as though it were loose in the oak.
Whereupon Siggeir offered money for the sword, but Sigmund
scorned the offer.</p>

<p>But in time Siggeir had his vengeance. Inviting King Volsung
and his sons to Gothland, he fell upon them, slew the king, and
suffered the sons, fastened under a log, to be devoured in succession
by a she-wolf&mdash;all but Sigmund, who through the wile of
his sister Signy was rescued. He, driven to the life of an outlaw,
sought means to avenge his father, and Signy, on her part, strove
to aid him,&mdash;without avail, however, till Sinfiotli, the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
herself and Sigmund, was grown to manhood. This youth bore
Sigmund company. For a season, as wolves, they scoured the
woods; finally resuming the form of men, they slew the children
of Siggeir and burned him in his hall. Signy, having helped to
avenge her father, died with her husband.</p>

<p>Sigmund, thereupon, became king, and took to himself a wife.
But she, suffering injury at the hands of Sinfiotli, poisoned him
with a horn of ale. Then Sigmund sorrowed nigh to death over
his son, and drove away that queen, and soon after she died. He
then married Hiordis the fair; but before long, doing battle against
Lyngi, the son of Hunding,&mdash;a chieftain who also had loved the
fair Hiordis,&mdash;he got his death wound:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">For lo, through the hedge of the war-shafts a mighty man there came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One-eyed and seeming ancient, but his visage shone like flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleaming-gray was his kirtle, and his hood was cloudy-blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he bore a mighty twibil, as he waded the fight-sheaves through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood face to face with Sigmund, and upheaved the bill to smite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more round the head of the Volsung fierce glittered the Branstock's light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword that came from Odin; and Sigmund's cry once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang out to the very heavens above the din of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then clashed the meeting edges with Sigmund's latest stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in shivering shards fell earthward that fear of worldly folk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But changed were the eyes of Sigmund, and the war-wrath left his face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that gray-clad mighty helper was gone, and in his place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drave on the unbroken spear-wood 'gainst the Volsung's empty hands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there they smote down Sigmund, the wonder of all lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the foemen, on the death-heap his deeds had piled that day.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To Hiordis, after Sigmund's death, was born <i>Sigurd</i>, like whom
was never man for comeliness and valor and great-heartedness and
might. He was the greatest of the Volsungs. His foster-father was
Regin, the son of Rodmar, a blacksmith, who taught him the lore
of runes and many tongues; and, by means of a story of ancient
wrongs, incited him to the destruction of the dragon Fafnir. For
Regin told that while the gods, Odin and H&oelig;nir, were wandering
with Loki near Rodmar's house, Loki slew one of Rodmar's sons,
Otter. Whereupon Rodmar demanded that the gods should fill
the Otter-skin with gold and cover it with gold. Now Loki, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
sent to procure the gold, caught Andvari the dwarf, and from him
procured by force a hoard of the precious metal and with it a magic
ring, whose touch bred gold. But Andvari cursed the ring and
the gold and all that might possess either. The gods forthwith
filled Otter with the dwarf's gold, and surrendered both gold and
ring to Rodmar. Immediately the curse began to work. Fafnir,
brother of Regin and Otter, slew Rodmar and seized the treasure
and, assuming a dragon's form, brooded upon the hoard. With
this tale Regin egged on Sigurd to the undoing of Fafnir. He
welded him, too, a resistless sword out of the shards of Sigmund's
sword, Gram (the wrath). Then Sigurd swore that he would slay
the dragon. But first, riding on his horse, Greyfell, of the blood
of Odin's Sleipnir, he avenged upon the sons of Hunding the
death of his father. This done, Sigurd rode to Glistenheath and
slew Fafnir, the dragon, and eating of his heart, learned the language
of the birds; and at their advice he slew Regin also, who
plotted against him.</p>

<p>So, setting the ring of Andvari on his finger and bearing the
gold before him on his horse, Greyfell, Sigurd comes to the Hill
of Hindfell:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And sitteth awhile on Greyfell on the marvelous thing to gaze:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For lo, the side of Hindfell inwrapped by the fervent blaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And naught 'twixt earth and heaven save a world of flickering flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a hurrying, shifting tangle, where the dark rents went and came....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Sigurd turns in his saddle, and the hilt of the Wrath he shifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And draws a girth the tighter; then the gathered reins he lifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crieth aloud to Greyfell, and rides at the wildfire's heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the white wall wavers before him and the flame-flood rusheth apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high o'er his head it riseth, and wide and wild is its roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it beareth the mighty tidings to the very heavenly floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he rideth through its roaring as the warrior rides the rye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When it bows with the wind of the summer and the hid spears draw anigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white-flame licks his raiment and sweeps through Greyfell's mane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bathes both hands of Sigurd and the hilts of Fafnir's bane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winds about his war-helm and mingles with his hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But naught his raiment dusketh or dims his glittering gear;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then it falls and fades and darkens till all seems left behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dawn and the blaze is swallowed in mid-mirk stark and blind....<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span></p>
<p>Then before him Sigurd sees a shield-hung castle, surmounted
by a golden buckler, instead of a banner, which rings against the
flagstaff. And he enters and finds the form of one asleep, in armor
cap-a-pie.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So he draweth the helm from the head, and, lo, the brow snow-white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the smooth unfurrowed cheeks, and the wise lips breathing light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the face of a woman it is, and the fairest that ever was born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shown forth to the empty heavens and the desert world forlorn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he looketh, and loveth her sore, and he longeth her spirit to move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And awaken her heart to the world, that she may behold him and love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he toucheth her breast and her hands, and he loveth her passing sore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saith, "Awake! I am Sigurd," but she moveth never the more....<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then with his bright blade Sigurd rends the ring-knit mail that
incloses her, "till naught but the rippling linen is wrapping her
about,"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then a flush cometh over her visage and a sigh upheaveth her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her eyelids quiver and open, and she wakeneth into rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide-eyed on the dawning she gazeth, too glad to change or smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And but little moveth her body, nor speaketh she yet for a while;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet kneels Sigurd, moveless, her wakening speech to heed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While soft the waves of the daylight o'er the starless heavens speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gleaming vines of the Shield-burg yet bright and brighter grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thin moon hangeth her horns dead-white in the golden glow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she turned and gazed on Sigurd, and her eyes met the Volsung's eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mighty and measureless now did the tide of his love arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their longing had met and mingled, and he knew of her heart that she loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she spake unto nothing but him and her lips with the speech-flood moved.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Brynhild, it was,&mdash;the Valkyrie,&mdash;who long time had lain in
that enchanted sleep that Odin, her father, had poured over her,
dooming her to mortal awakening and to mortal love, for the evil
she had wrought of old when she espoused the cause in battle of
those whom the Norns had predestined to death. Her might none
but the fearless awaken; and her had Sigurd awakened; and she
loved him, for he was without fear and godlike. And she taught
him many wise sayings; and they plighted troth, one to the other,
both then and again; and Sigurd gave her the ring of Andvari.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
But they were not destined to dwell together in wedlock, and
Brynhild, foreseeing the future, knew even this.</p>

<p>Sigurd was to wed with another than Brynhild, and it fell in
this wise. In the land of the Nibelungs (Niblungs, Nibelungen)
dwelt Gudrun, daughter of Giuki, the Nibelung king. And Gudrun
dreamed a dream in which a fair hawk feathered with feathers of
gold alighted upon her wrist. She went to Brynhild for the interpretation
of the dream. "The hawk," said Brynhild, "is Sigurd."
And so it came to pass. Sigurd, visiting the court of the Nibelungs,
was kindly entreated by King Giuki and his three sons, Gunnar,
Hogni, and Guttorm; and he performed deeds of valor such that
they honored him. But after many days, Grimhild, the mother
of Gudrun, administered to Sigurd a magic potion that removed
from him all memory of Brynhild. So Sigurd loved and wedded
the fair Gudrun. Indeed he soon joined others in urging his
wife's brother Gunnar, a doughty warrior, to sue for the hand of
Brynhild herself. But Brynhild would have no one that could
not ride through the flames drawn up around her hall. After
Gunnar had made two unsuccessful attempts, Sigurd, assuming
the form of King Gunnar, mounted Greyfell and rode for the
second time through the flames of Hindfell. Then, still wearing
the semblance of Gunnar, he gained the consent of Brynhild to
the union, and exchanged rings with her,&mdash;she giving him
none other than the ancient ring of Andvari back again. But
even this did not recall to Sigurd's memory his former ride and
his former love. Returning to the land of the Nibelungs, he
announced the success of his undertaking and told all things to
Gudrun, giving her the fatal ring that he had regained from
Brynhild.</p>

<p>In ten days came Brynhild by agreement to the Hall of the
Nibelungs, and though she knew well the deceit that had been
practiced on her, she made no sign; nay, was wedded, according
to her promise, to King Gunnar. But as they sat at the wedding-feast,
the charm of Grimhild was outworn,&mdash;Sigurd looked upon
Gunnar's bride and knew the Brynhild of old, the Valkyrie, whom
he had loved; "and Brynhild's face drew near him with eyes
grown stern and strange."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span></p>

<p>But, apparently, all went well till the young queens, one day
bathing in the Water of the Nibelungs, fell into contention on a
matter of privilege. Brynhild claimed precedence in entering the
river on the ground that Gunnar was the liege lord of Sigurd.
Gudrun, white with wrath, flashed out the true story of the ride
through the flames, and thrust in Brynhild's face the Andvari
ring. Consumed with jealousy, Brynhild plotted revenge. She
loved Sigurd still, and he, since he had regained his memory,
could not overcome his love for her. But the insult from Gudrun
Brynhild would not brook. By her machinations, Guttorm, the
brother of Gudrun, was incited to slay Sigurd. He, accordingly,
stabbed the hero while asleep, but Sigurd, throwing Gram at the
assassin, cut him in twain before he could escape.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Woe me! how the house of the Niblungs by another cry was rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The awakening wail of Gudrun, as she shrank in the river of blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the breast of the mighty Sigurd: he heard it and understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rose up on the sword of Guttorm, and turned from the country of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake words of loving-kindness as he strove for life and breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Wail not, O child of the Niblungs! I am smitten, but thou shalt live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In remembrance of our glory, mid the gifts the gods shall give!...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is Brynhild's deed," he murmured, "and the woman that loves me well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought now is left to repent of, and the tale abides to tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have done many deeds in my life-days, and all these, and my love, they lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the hollow hand of Odin till the day of the world go by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have done and I may not undo, I have given and I take not again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou other than I, Allfather, wilt thou gather my glory in vain?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So ended the life of Sigurd. Brynhild, overcome with sorrow,
dealt herself a mortal wound and was burned on the funeral pyre
beside Sigurd the Volsung.</p>

<p>In time Gudrun became the queen of Atli, the Budlung. He,
in order to obtain the hoard of Sigurd, which had passed into the
hands of the Nibelungs,&mdash;Gudrun's brothers,&mdash;bade them visit
him in Hunland. Fully warned by Gudrun, they still accepted the
invitation and, arriving at the hall of Atli, were after a fearful conflict
slain. But they did not surrender the hoard&mdash;that lay concealed
at the bottom of the Rhine. Gudrun with the aid of Nibelung,
her brother Hogni's son, in the end slew Atli, set fire to his hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
and brought ruin on the Budlung folk. Then leaping into the sea,
she was borne with Swanhild, her daughter by Sigurd, to the realm
of King Jonakr, who became her third husband. Swanhild, "fairest
of all women, eager-eyed as her father, so that few durst look
under the brows of her," met, by stress of love and treachery, a
foul end in a foreign land, trampled under foot of horses.</p>

<p>Finally Gudrun sent her sons by Jonakr to avenge their half-sister's
death; and so, bereft of all her kin and consumed with
sorrow, she called upon her ancient lover, Sigurd, to come and
look upon her, as he had promised, from his abiding-place among
the dead. And thus had the words of her sorrow an end.</p>

<p>Her sons slew Jormunrek, the murderer of Swanhild, but were
themselves done to death by the counsel and aid of a certain warrior,
seeming ancient and one-eyed,&mdash;Odin the forefather of the
Volsungs,&mdash;the same that had borne Sigi fellowship, and that
struck the sword into Branstock of Volsung's hall, and that faced
Sigmund and shattered Gram in the hour of Sigmund's need, and
that brought to Sigurd the matchless horse Greyfell, and oft again
had appeared to the kin of the Volsungs;&mdash;the same god now
wrought the end of the Nibelungs. The hoard and the ring of
Andvari had brought confusion on all into whose hands they fell.</p>

<p><b>283. The Lay of the Nibelungs.</b><a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> In the German version of this
story&mdash;called the Nibelungenlied&mdash;certain variations of name,
incident, and character appear. Sigurd is Siegfried, dwelling in
Xanten near the Rhine, the son of Siegmund and Siegelind, king
and queen of the Netherlands. Gudrun is Kriemhild, sister of
Gunther (Gunnar), king of the Burgundians, and niece of Hagen
(Hogni), a warrior of dark and sullen mien, cunning, but withal
loyal and brave, the foe of the glorious Siegfried. Siegfried weds
Kriemhild, takes her to the Netherlands and lives happily with her,
enjoying the moneys of the Nibelungen hoard, which he had taken
not from a dwarf, as in the Norse version, but from two princes,
the sons of King Nibelung. Meanwhile Gunther dwells in peace
in the Burgundian land, husband of the proud Brunhild, whom
Siegfried had won for him by stratagem not altogether unlike that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>of the Norse story. For the Brunhild of the Yssel-land had declared
that she would marry no man save him who should surpass
her in athletic contest. This condition Siegfried, wearing the Tarnkappe,
a cloak that rendered him invisible, had fulfilled for Gunther.
He had also succored poor Gunther after his marriage with
Brunhild. For that heroine, in contempt of Gunther's strength,
had bound him hand
and foot and suspended
him from a nail on their
bedroom wall. By
agreement Siegfried
had again assumed Gunther's
form and, after a
fearful tussle with the
queen, had reduced her
to submission, taking
from her the ring and
girdle which were the
secret sources of her
strength, and leaving
her to imagine that she
had been conquered by
her bridegroom, Gunther.
The ring and
girdle Siegfried had bestowed
upon Kriemhild,
unwisely telling her at
the same time the story of Brunhild's defeat. Although the Nibelungenlied
offers no explanation, it is evident that the injured queen
of Yssel-land had recognized Siegfried during this ungallant intrigue;
and we are led to infer that there had been some previous
acquaintance and passage of love between them.</p>

</div>

<p>At any rate, Siegfried and Kriemhild, retiring to the Netherlands,
were ruling happily at Xanten by the Rhine; and all might
have continued in peace had not Brunhild resented the lack of
homage paid by Siegfried, whom she had been led to regard as a
vassal, to Gunther, his reputed overlord.</p>

<span class="i0">... With what joy and gladness welcomed were they there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed when came dame Brunhild to Burgundy whilere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her welcome by dame Kriemhild less tender was and true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart of each beholder beat higher at the view....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Received was bold Sir Siegfried, as fitted well his state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the highest honors; no man bore him hate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Giselher and Gernot proffered all courtly care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never met friend or kinsman reception half so fair.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One day at the hour of vespers certain knights proved themselves
at tilting in the regal courtyard. Conspicuous among these
was Siegfried. And the proud queens sitting together were thinking
each on the good knight that she loved full well. Then outspoke
fair Kriemhild, "My husband is of such might that surely
he should rule these realms"; Brunhild answered, "So long as
Gunther lives that can never be."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... Thereto rejoined fair Kriemhild, "See'st thou how proud he stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How proud he stalks, conspicuous among those warrior bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As doth the moon far-beaming the glimmering stars outshine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure have I cause to pride me when such a knight is mine."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thereto replied queen Brunhild, "How brave soe'er he be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How stout soe'er or stately, one greater is than he.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gunther, thy noble brother, a higher place may claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of knights and kings the foremost in merit and in fame."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So began the altercation. It attained its climax the same day,
when each queen attempted to take precedence of the other in
entering the cathedral for the celebration of the mass.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Both met before the minster in all the people's sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There at once the hostess let out her deadly spite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bitterly and proud she bade fair Kriemhild stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No vassaless precedeth the lady of the land."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then, full of wrath, Kriemhild, in terms anything but delicate,
acquainted her haughty sister-in-law with the deception that had
twice been practiced upon her by Siegfried and Gunther; nay,
worse, corroborated her statement by displaying both ring and
girdle that Brunhild had lost. The altercation came to the ears
of the kings. Gunther made complaint to Siegfried. Then,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... "Women must be instructed," said Siegfried, the good knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To leave off idle talking and rule their tongues aright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep thy fair wife in order, I'll do by mine the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such overweening folly puts me indeed to shame."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But it was too late to mend the matter. With devilish intent Brunhild
plotted vengeance. Siegfried, the author of her mortification,
must die the death. The foes of Siegfried persuaded his wife, unaware
of their design, to embroider in his vesture a silken cross over
the one spot where the hero was vulnerable. Then the crafty Hagen,
who had been suborned by Brunhild to the baleful deed, bided his
time. One day, Gunther, Hagen, and Siegfried, heated in running,
stayed by a brook to drink. Hagen saw his chance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... Then, as to drink, Sir Siegfried down kneeling there he found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He pierced him through the crosslet, that sudden from the wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth the life-blood spurted, e'en o'er his murderer's weed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nevermore will warrior dare so foul a deed....<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">... With blood were all bedabbled the flowerets of the field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some time with death he struggled as though he scorned to yield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en to the foe whose weapon strikes down the loftiest head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last prone in the meadow lay mighty Siegfried dead.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Brunhild glories in the fall of Siegfried and exults over the
mourning widow. Kriemhild, sitting apart, nurses schemes of
vengeance. Her brothers affect to patch up the breach in order
that they may obtain the hoard of the Nibelungs. But this treasure,
after it has been brought to Worms, is sunk, for precaution's
sake, by Hagen, in the Rhine. Although in time Kriemhild becomes
the wife of King Etzel (Atli, Attila) of Hunland, still she
does not forget the injury done her by her kin. After thirteen
years she inveigles her brothers and their retainers, called now
Nibelungs because of their possession of the hoard, to Etzel's
court, where, after a desperate and dastardly encounter, in which
their hall is reduced to ashes, they are all destroyed save Gunther
and Hagen. Immediately, thereafter, Gunther's head is cut off at
her orders; and she herself, with Siegfried's sword Balmung,
severs the head of the hated Hagen from his body. With these
warriors the secret of the hidden hoard passes. Kriemhild, having
wreaked her vengeance, falls by the hand of one of her husband's
knights, Hildebrand, who, with Dietrich of Bern, had played a
prominent part among the associates of King Etzel.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />

<span class="ph4">THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG</span></h3>


<p><b>284. Wagner's Tetralogy.</b> In his famous Ring of the Nibelung
the German composer, Richard Wagner, returns to the Norse version
of the stories recounted in the chapter preceding this. He is responsible
not only for the musical score of the four operas of which the
Ring consists, but for the text and scenic arrangement as well. As
musical dramas the four plays constitute the grandest series of the
kind that the world possesses. But even if they were not wedded
to such music, the <i>Rhine-gold</i>, the <i>Valkyrie</i>, the <i>Siegfried</i>, and
the <i>Twilight</i> (or <i>Dusk</i>) <i>of the Gods</i> would be entitled, for creative
invention, imaginative insight and power, and poetic diction, to rank
with notable dramas, ancient or modern. The tetralogy (or series
of four) presents the whole story of the accursed Nibelung gold,
from that dawn when it was wrested from the daughters of the
Rhine to that dusk when it was restored, having wrought meanwhile
the doom of Nibelungs, Volsungs, and the gods themselves.</p>

<p><b>285. The Rhine-gold.</b> We are at the bottom of the Rhine: a
greenish twilight, and moving water, and everywhere sharp points
of rocks jutting from the depths. Around the central rock three
Rhine-daughters swim, guarding it carefully, but laughing and
playing, and chasing one the other as they guard. To them from
a chasm climbs Alberich, the Nibelung, he who in the old Norse
lay was known as Andvari. He views the maidens with increasing
pleasure. He addresses them, he clambers after them, he strives
to catch them; they lure him on, they mock him and escape his
grasp; he woos them each in turn, all unsuccessfully. He gazes
upward&mdash;"Could I but catch one"; then once more failing, remains
in speechless rage. Rage soon transformed to wonder: for
through the water from above there filters a brightening glow, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
magical light, streaming from the summit of the central rock where
in the splendor of the morning sun the Rhine-gold laughs a-kindle.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What is it, ye sleek ones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That there doth gleam and glow?"<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Has he never heard of the Rhine-gold? they ask. Of the wondrous
star whose glory lightens the waves? He has not. He scorns it.</p>

<p>"The golden charm," cries one of the maidens,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"The golden charm<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wouldst thou not flout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knewest thou all of its wonders."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The world's wealth," jeers another,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Could be won by a man<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If out of the Rhine-gold<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He fashioned the Ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That measureless might can bestow...<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He who the sway<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of love forswears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He who delight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of love forbears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only he can master the magic<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That forces the gold to a ring!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But we fear not thee&mdash;oh, no&mdash;for thou burnest in love for us."</p>

<p>So, lightly sing the Rhine-daughters; but Alberich, with his
eyes on the gold, has heeded well their chatter. "The world's
wealth," he mutters; "might I win that by the spell of the gold?
Nay, though love be the forfeit, my cunning shall win me delight."
Then terribly loud he cries,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Mock ye, mock on!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Nibelung neareth your toy;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>then, clambering with haste to the summit,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My hand, it quenches your light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wrest from the rock your gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fashion the ring of revenge;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, hear me, ye floods&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accurs&egrave;d be love henceforth."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span></p>
<p>Tearing the gold from the rock, he plunges into the depths and
disappears. After him dive the maidens. In vain. Far, far below,
from Nibelheim rises the mocking laughter of Alberich, Lord of
the Gold.</p>

<p>The scene changes. An open space on a mountain height becomes
visible. The dawning day lights up a castle, glittering with
pinnacles, on the top of a cliff. Below flows silent the Rhine. At
one side, on a flowery bank, Wotan (Odin), king of the gods, lies
sleeping, and Fricka (Frigga) his wife. They wake. Wotan turns
toward his castle, new-built by the giants, and exults; but Fricka
reminds him of the terrible price that is yet to be paid for its building,&mdash;none
other, forsooth, than the person of Freia, the fair one,
the goddess of spring and love, she who tends the garden of the
gods, and whose apples, eaten from day to day, confer eternal
youth,&mdash;she is the wage that the giants will claim.</p>

<p>"I mind me well of the bargain," returns Wotan, "but I give
no thought to fulfill it. My castle stands; for the wage&mdash;fret not
thyself."</p>

<p>"Oh, laughing, impious lightness," reproves him Fricka, "thy
bargain is fast, and is still to rue."</p>

<p>Nay, on the moment rushes Freia to them, pleading, pursued
by the giants. "Give her to us!" they cry,&mdash;Fasolt and Fafner,
mighty twain that unslumbering had reared the walls of Wotan's
castle, to win them a woman, winsome and sweet.</p>

<p>"Now pay us our wage!"</p>

<p>"Nay," coolly answers Wotan, "other guerdon ask. Freia may
I not grant!"</p>

<p>But the giants insist. They accuse the god of faithlessness. He
jests with them, temporizing, awaiting anxiously the arrival of
Loge (Loki), spirit of cunning, at whose suggestion that bargain
had been struck. For even then Loge had secretly assured Wotan
that Freia should in the emergency be ransomed. The giants,
indignant at the delay, press on Freia. She calls on her brothers,
Froh (Freyr) and Donner (Thor). They rush to her rescue: Froh
clasps the fair one; Donner plants himself before the importunates.</p>

<p>"Know ye the weight of my hammer's blow?" thunders he.</p>

<p>There is battle in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p>Then enters Loge, demon of fire, mischief-maker, traitor, and
thief, whom long ago Wotan had lifted from his evil brood and
of him made a friend and counselor.</p>

<p>"Now hear, crabb&egrave;d one; keep thy word," says Wotan, sharply.</p>

<p>Loge appears to be nonplussed. He has restlessly searched to
the ends of the world to find a ransom for Freia; "but naught is
so rich that giant or man will take it as price for a woman's worth
and delight." He has sought amid the forces of water and earth
and air; "but naught is so mighty that giant or man will prefer it
above a woman's worth and delight!" And yet,&mdash;slyly Loge lets
fall the word,&mdash;there is the ruddy Gold:</p>

<p>"Yea, one I looked on, but <i>one</i>, who love's delights forswore,
for ruddy gold renouncing the wealth of woman's grace."</p>

<p>And he recounts the marvels of the Rhine-gold. The giants
offer to take it in lieu of Freia; nay, gods and goddesses as well
are held by the charm of the glittering hoard; by the lure, and
the dread too, of the Ring that, once fashioned, gives measureless
might to its lord. Even now, doubtless, he who has forsworn love
has muttered the magic rune and rounded the sovereign circlet of
gold. If so, the gods themselves shall be his slaves,&mdash;slaves of
the Nibelung Alberich.</p>

<p>"The ring I must win me," decides Wotan.</p>

<p>"But at the cost of love?" queries Froh.</p>

<p>Loge counsels the theft of the gold from Alberich and its restoration
to the daughters of the Rhine. But the gods are not thus far-sighted,
and the giants insist upon the hoard as their due. They seize
Freia, and bear her away as pledge till that ransom be paid....</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Alack, what aileth the gods?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is Loge who speaks. A pale mist falls upon the scene, gradually
growing denser. The light of the heavenly abodes is quenched. Wotan
and all his clan become increasingly wan and aged. Freia of the
Garden is departed: the apples of youth are decaying; "old and gray,
worn and withered, the scoff of the world, dies out the godly race!"</p>

<p>"Up, Loge," calls Wotan, dismayed, "descend with me. To
Nibelheim go we together. To win back our youth, the golden
ransom must I gain."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span></p>

<p>The scene changes to Nibelheim, the subterranean home of the
Nibelungs. Wotan and Loge find Mime, Alberich's brother, bewailing
the fate of the Nibelungs&mdash;for Alberich has fashioned
the Ring and all below groan under his tyranny. Even now, reluctantly
indeed, Mime is forging the <i>Tarnhelm</i> for his tyrant brother,&mdash;a
wishing-cap by whose magic the wearer may transfer himself
through space and assume whatever form he please, or make himself
invisible, at will. Alberich, in the flush of power, enters, driving
before him with brandished whip a host of Nibelungs from
the caverns. They are laden with gold and silver handiwork. At
Alberich's command they heap it in a pile. He draws the Ring from
his finger; the vanquished host trembles and, shrieking, cowers
away.</p>

<p>"What seek ye here?" demands he, looking long and suspiciously
at Wotan and Loge.</p>

<p>They have heard strange tidings, says Wotan, and they come to
see the wonders that Alberich can work. Then Loge induces the
Nibelung lord to exhibit the virtues of the Tarnhelm. Readily
beguiled, he displays his necromantic power. First he transforms
himself into a loathly dragon. The gods pretend dismay:&mdash;he
can make himself great; can he make himself small, likewise?
"Pah, nothing simpler! Look at me now!" He dons the Tarnhelm,
and lo, a toad!</p>

<p>"There, grasp quickly," says Loge. Wotan places his foot on
the toad, and Loge seizes the Tarnhelm. Alberich becomes visible
in his own form, writhing under Wotan's foot. The gods bind him
and drag him to the chasm by which they had descended.</p>

<p>The scene changes to the open space before Valhalla. Alberich,
dragged in by Loge, is forced to deliver up the hoard and the
Tarnhelm and the Ring. Wotan contemplates the Ring and puts
it on. Alberich is set at liberty.</p>

<p>"Am I now free?" cries he, "free in sooth? Thus greets you
then my freedom's foremost word: As by curse it came to me, accursed
forever be this Ring! As its gold gave measureless might,
let now its magic deal death to its lord. Its wealth shall yield
pleasure to none. Care shall consume him who doth hold it. All
shall lust after its delights; yet naught shall it boot him who wins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
the prize! To its lord no gain let it bring; and forever be murder
drawn in its wake, till again once more in my hand, rewon, I
hold it!"</p>

<p>So the baffled Nibelung curses, and departs. Then enter Fricka,
Donner, and Froh, followed soon by the giants, who bring Freia
back. They refuse, Fasolt and Fafner, to release the fair goddess
until she is fully redeemed; and they claim not only Tarnhelm
and gold, but Ring as well. With the Ring Wotan refuses to part.
In that moment rises from a rocky cleft the goddess of the earth,
Erda, the beloved of heaven's god, and mother by him of the
Valkyries.</p>

<p>"Yield it, Wotan, yield it," she cries warningly. "Flee the
Ring's dread curse."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What woman warneth me thus?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"All that e'er was, know I," pronounces Erda:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"How all things are;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How all things shall be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear me! hear me! hear me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that e'er was, endeth:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A darksome day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dawns for your godhood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be counseled; give up the Ring."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She vanishes, the all-wise one; and Wotan surrenders the Ring.
Freia is redeemed, and the gods glow again with youth. No sooner
have the giants gained possession of the Ring than they proceed
to quarrel over it. Fafner strikes out with his staff and stretches
Fasolt on the ground. From the dying man he hastily wrests the
Ring, puts it into his sack, and goes on quietly packing the gold.
In a solemn silence the gods stand horrified. Care and fear fetter
the soul of Wotan. That he may shake himself free of them he
determines to descend to Erda; she yet can give him counsel.
But first,&mdash;for Donner has cleared with his thunder and lightning
the clouds that had overspread the scene,&mdash;he will enter "Valhalla,"
his castle, golden-gleaming in the evening sunlight.</p>

<p>"What meaneth the name, then?" asks Fricka, as they cross
the rainbow bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p>Wotan evades the question, for he still dreads the curse pronounced
by the Nibelung upon all who have owned the Ring; and
that name, "Valhalla," indicates just the means by which he hopes
to escape the curse. He has thought to avert the doom of the gods
by gathering in this Valhalla, or Hall of the Slain, the spirits of
heroes fallen in battle&mdash;especially of heroes of a race that shall
spring from himself, the Volsungs (or W&auml;lsungs) yet to be born.
They shall do battle for the gods when sounds the crack of doom.
But of all this Wotan says naught. He will say in the hour of his
triumph.</p>

<p>As the gods enter Valhalla the plaints of the Rhine-maidens
for the loss of their gold arise from the river below.</p>

<p><b>286.</b> In <b>The Valkyrie</b> Wotan proceeds with his plan. During
his wanderings on earth, under the name of W&auml;lse, he has become
the father of twin children, Siegmund and Sieglinde. These have,
in early youth, been separated by the murderous turmoil of warring
clans, but now they are to be reunited; and Wotan, with a primitive
disregard of the fact that they are brother and sister, intends
to make them man and wife, in order that from them may issue
the heroic race that, in the latter days, shall defend Valhalla from
the onslaught of the powers of evil.</p>

<p>The play opens with the interior of a woodland lodge. In the
center rises the stem of a mighty ash tree, about which has been
built an apartment of roughly hewn logs. It is toward evening
and a violent thunderstorm is just subsiding. This is the home
of Hunding, chieftain of the Neiding clan. The door opens, and
Siegmund, flying from his enemies, wounded and weaponless,
enters. Seeing no one, he closes the door, strides toward the fire,
and throws himself wearily down on a bearskin:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whoe'er own this hearth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here must I rest me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He remains stretched out motionless. A woman enters from an
inner chamber. It is Sieglinde. She takes compassion on the
helpless fugitive, admires his noble bearing, gives him drink, and
bids him tarry till her husband be home. They gaze upon each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
other with ever-increasing interest and emotion. Suddenly Siegmund
starts up as if to go.</p>

<p>"Who pursues thee?" she inquires.</p>

<p>"Ill fate pursues where'er I go. To thee, wife, may it never
come. Forth from thy house I fly."</p>

<p>She calls him back. "Then bide thou here. Thou canst not
bring ill fate where ill fate already makes its home."</p>

<p>He leans against the hearth. Again the eyes of the twain meet.</p>

<p>Hunding enters, regards the stranger with suspicion, notes the
resemblance between him and Sieglinde; but he consents to harbor
him for the night.</p>

<p>"Thy name and fortune?"</p>

<p>"Wehwalt," says Siegmund, "for woe still waits on my steps;
Wehwalt, the son of Wolfe." And thus concealing his race, he
tells a story in other respects true: how in his childhood a cruel
host had laid waste his home and killed his mother and carried
away the sister who was his twin, and how he and his father, the
Wolf, for years had battled in the woodlands against the Neidings.</p>

<p>The Neidings! They are Hunding's clan.</p>

<p>"My house holds thee, W&ouml;lfing, to-night. To-morrow defend
thee; with death thou shalt pay for this life!" And Hunding
withdraws, Sieglinde with him.</p>

<p>Siegmund is weaponless. The firelight sends a sudden glow
upon the ash tree, and a sword-hilt there sends back an answering
gleam. But Siegmund knows not what it means. Clad in white,
Sieglinde steals from the inner room. She has left Hunding
asleep, overcome by a slumberous draft.</p>

<p>"Thy coming is life," cries Siegmund.</p>

<p>"A weapon, now, let me show thee," she replies. And she tells
how, on the day of her unhappy wedding, a stranger, all in gray,
low-hatted and one-eyed, had entered the Hunding hall and struck
into the ash stem a sword that none but the bravest of heroes could
win, and how all in turn had tried in vain to draw forth the sword.
Now she knows for whom it was ordained,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was for thee, my deliverer, my hero held in my arms!"</p>

<p>They embrace. He declares his lineage. He is son of him
whose eye proudly glistened from under the low-brimmed hat,&mdash;son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
of W&auml;lse, the wanderer. He is Siegmund, the Victorious. For
him, the sword Nothung.&mdash;And he draws it easily forth.</p>

<p>"Art thou Siegmund?" she cries; "Sieglinde am I. Thine
own twin sister thou winnest at once with the sword."</p>

<p>"Bride and sister be to thy brother; then nourish the W&auml;lsungs
for aye!"</p>

<p>So the twain make their compact.</p>

<p>In the second act we are transported to a wild and rocky place.
Before Wotan, fully armed and carrying his spear, stands Br&uuml;nnhilde,
the warrior maid, likewise fully armed. She is one of the
nine Valkyries, daughters of Wotan and Erda, fostered for battle
that they might forfend the doom foretold by Erda herself,&mdash;the
shameful defeat of the gods. Well have the Valkyrs, choosers
of the slain, performed their task, stirring mortal hearts to battle
and riding through the air above to designate the bravest for
death, and with their spirits to fill the halls on Valhalla's height.
Now, however, Wotan is ordering Br&uuml;nnhilde to haste to the
fray,&mdash;not on death's errand but on errand of life,&mdash;to shield
Siegmund the W&auml;lsung in the fight. The Valkyrie springs
shouting from rock to rock, and disappears behind the mountain
crags.</p>

<p>All seems to be arranged. But lo, Fricka, in her ram-drawn
car! She descends and strides toward her scheming spouse. The
goddess has heard the cry of Hunding, calling for vengeance on
the twinborn pair who have rashly wrought him wrong; and as
guardian of wedlock she demands the death of Siegmund in the
coming conflict. Wotan tries to persuade her that Siegmund's
success is needful to the gods,&mdash;the warrior band of mortal souls
gathered by the Valkyries in the heights of Valhalla cannot alone
suffice to avert the onslaught of the powers of darkness.</p>

<p>"Needed is one who, free from help of godhood, fights free
of the godhead's control. Only such an one is meet for the deed
which is denied to a god to achieve."</p>

<p>But Fricka is not to be deceived nor thwarted in her aim. She
brushes aside the plea of Wotan and his subterfuge,&mdash;who has
ever heard that heroes can accomplish what the gods cannot? And
as for heroes unaided&mdash;none such is Siegmund.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who was it," she asks, "that brought him his conquering
sword? and whose shield is ordained to cover him in the fight?"</p>

<p>"I cannot o'erthrow him," breaks out Wotan; "he has found
my sword."</p>

<p>"Destroy its magic then," retorts the implacable queen. "Give
word to thy shouting war-maid that Siegmund fall!"</p>

<p>Wotan is conquered. Sadly he revokes the order given to Br&uuml;nnhilde.</p>

<p>"Then takest thou from Siegmund thy shield?" cries that one
in amazement.</p>

<p>And the god: "Yea! though Alberich's host threaten our downfall;
though again the Ring be won by the Nibelung, and Valhalla
be lost forever. By bargains bound myself, I may not wrest the
Ring from the foeman, from Fafner the giant. Therefore, to fulfill
my purpose, I had thought to create a Free One who for me should
fight. Now, with loathing, I find ever myself in all my hand has
created. The Other for whom I have longed, that Other I never
shall find. Himself must the Free One create him; my hand
shapes nothing but slaves. For when this hand of mine touched
Alberich's Ring, my heart grew greedy of gold. I fled from the
curse, but the curse flies not from me. What I love best must I
surrender; whom most I cherish, I must slay. One thing awaits
me yet&mdash;the downfall! Yea, that portended Erda,&mdash;Erda, the
all-wise.</p>

<p>"'When the dusky foe,' she said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When the dusky foe of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grimly getteth a son,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The doom of the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Delays not long!'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And of late I have heard that the Nibelung has bought him a
wife. Their son shall inherit,&mdash;their son, the child of spite, shall
inherit the empty pomp of the gods!"</p>

<p>It was of Hagen, yet unborn, the baleful curse of the Volsungs,
of Hagen, the traitor, that Erda had prophesied. And thus dimly
is foreshadowed the Twilight of the Gods.</p>

<p>But Br&uuml;nnhilde?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span></p>

<p>"Siegmund thou hast taught me to love," murmurs the Valkyrie.
Then boldly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"For his sake thy wavering word I defy!"</p>

<p>The war-father turns in wrath upon this new rebellion, and on
pain of eternal penalty enjoins upon his daughter her new duty:</p>

<p>"Fight truly for Fricka! Siegmund strike thou! Such be the
Valkyrie's task!"</p>

<p>The war-maid seeks out Siegmund and announces to him his
approaching death. But that hero's distress at the thought of parting
from Sieglinde stirs her to the quick. And, in the moment
of battle, Br&uuml;nnhilde disobeys the All-father's injunction;&mdash;she
shields the warrior whom she loves. Then suddenly appears Wotan,
standing over Hunding and holding his spear across in front of
Siegmund.</p>

<p>"Go back from the spear! In splinters the sword!" shouts
the god.</p>

<p>In terror Br&uuml;nnhilde sinks back. Siegmund's sword breaks on
the outstretched spear, and Hunding pierces the Volsung's breast.
Br&uuml;nnhilde hastily gathers the bits of the broken sword, lifts Sieglinde
to horse, and escapes through the gorges behind.</p>

<p>The scene changes to the Valkyries' rocky home. Through the
drifting clouds come riding the eight sisters of Br&uuml;nnhilde, in full
armor each, and each bearing before her the body of some slain
hero. They await Br&uuml;nnhilde. She, fleeing from Wotan's pursuit,
at last arrives. She implores them to shield Sieglinde from the
wrath of the god, but unsuccessfully; and then she urges Sieglinde
to fly. At first, benumbed by despair, the widowed woman refuses;
but when Br&uuml;nnhilde mentions the child that is to be born&mdash;the
world's most glorious hero&mdash;she consents.</p>

<p>"Him thou shalt bear, thy son and Siegmund's. For him ward
thou well these mighty splinters of his father's sword. He shall
weld them anew and swing the victorious blade! His name from me
let him take&mdash;'Siegfried'; for Siegfried in <i>triumph</i> shall live!"</p>

<p>Comforted and hopeful, Sieglinde betakes herself to that forest
far to the east, where the Nibelung's hoard had been borne by Fafner.
There, in dragon's form, he guarded the gold and the Ring;
and thither Wotan is not likely to pursue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

<p>It thunders and lightens. Wotan, raging terribly, strides from
crag to crag. The other Valkyries are driven from the scene.
Br&uuml;nnhilde hears her doom:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"The heavenly host<br /></span>
<span class="i6">No more shall know thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Outcast art thou<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The bond by thee has been broken;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Henceforth from sight of my face art thou banned!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Immortal, she had followed the might of love; mortal, now she
shall sleep, and that sleep shall endure till one comes to awaken her;
and to him, whosoe'er it may be, she shall be subject thenceforth.</p>

<p>The Valkyrie drops to her knees:</p>

<p>"Ah, let no craven awake me!" she cries. "Surround me with
horrors, with fires that shall fright: that none but the most fearless
of heroes may find me here on the fell!"</p>

<p>Wotan accedes to her petition. He kisses her on both eyes and
lays her unconscious, asleep, in the shade of a broad-branching fir
tree. Then,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Appear! Come, waving fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wind thee in flames round the fell!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Loge, Loge, appear!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A sea of flames encircles the spot, and Wotan proclaims:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"He who my spear-point's<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Sharpness feareth<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Alone, under her long steel shield, sleeps the Valkyrie.</p>

<p><b>287. Siegfried.</b> The drama of Siegfried opens in the cavern of
Mime, in the forest "far to the east" to which Sieglinde had fled.
Mime, the dwarf, is he whom erstwhile his Nibelung brother, Alberich,
then lord of the Ring, had held in thrall at the bottom of the
Rhine. Some years before the events represented in this play, the
dwarf had found Sieglinde dying in the woods, and had received
from her Siegfried, her new-born son, and with him the pieces of
Siegmund's broken sword, Nothung.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>Young Siegfried, noble, proud, and strong, has been nurtured
in ignorance of his lineage and destiny, as Mime's son. But of
that lineage and destiny the cunning dwarf is well aware; and
while he trains Siegfried to doughty deeds, he ceaselessly forges
at the splinters of the sword, hoping to reweld them himself and
through Siegfried's might to win victory over Fafner, the present
lord of the Ring, and so achieve unmeasured wealth and the mastery
of the world. But Siegfried despises his foster-father and
seeks ever to discover the story of his own descent. The attempts
of Mime to shape anew the pieces of Nothung fail; and he daily
forges other swords, which Siegfried scorns and breaks at the first
trial. In the course of time, however, there comes to Mime's cave a
"Wanderer"&mdash;it is Wotan himself&mdash;and tells the dwarf that
only one, a man who knows not fear, can remake the all-conquering
sword. He tells him, too, of the mighty spear, fashioned of
the world ash tree's hallowed branches, with which he, Wotan, rules
the earth. But no word he says of the doom that is to befall that
spear at the blow of the conquering sword,&mdash;the doom, forsooth,
of the gods themselves.</p>

<p>Mime, after trying in vain to arouse in Siegfried the sense of
fear, suggests to the youth that he try to reforge Nothung. Siegfried
seizes the splinters, pounds them, and files them to powder;
melts them over the charcoal of the ash tree's stem, and, singing
at his work, refashions the sword. While this is doing, through
the pauses of Siegfried's song can be heard the voice of Mime,
muttering: "The sword will be forged ... and Fafner vanquished....
When Siegfried has slain that dragon ... he will
be athirst.... I will brew him a drink.... One drop will lay
him in sleep.... With the sword that he forges I'll kill him....
Mine, then, the Ring and the hoard!"</p>

<p>At last the sword is shaped and sharpened. Siegfried swings it
before him:</p>

<p>"Nothung, Nothung, conquering sword; again to life have I
woke thee! Strike at the traitor, cut down the knave! See, Mime,
thou smith; so sunders Siegfried's sword!" and he strikes the
anvil in twain from top to bottom. It falls asunder with a great
noise, and the dwarf drops with terror to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span></p>

<p>The scene changes to the forest in front of Fafner's cave.
Alberich is watching gloomily by, and the Wanderer rides in to
taunt him with false hope of the Ring.</p>

<p>"A hero nears to set free the hoard," says the Wanderer. "Fafner
will fall. Perchance if Alberich warn the dragon, he may win
the Ring in token of gratitude."</p>

<p>Alberich makes the approaches. Fafner yawns: "I have and I
hold; let me slumber!"</p>

<p>With scornful laughter the Wanderer rides away. But "one
day," snarls Alberich,&mdash;"one day shall I see you all fade, ye
light-hearted eternals. The wise one keepeth his watch and surely
worketh his spite!"</p>

<p>As the day breaks Siegfried and Mime enter, Siegfried wearing
his sword hung in a girdle of rope, and blithely blowing a horn.
Fafner, in the shape of a huge lizardlike dragon, comes out of his
cave and forward to the stream for water. At sight of the nonchalant
youth piping his wood-notes gay, the monster emits a snort
that serves his need of a laugh,&mdash;"I came for drink; now, too, I
find food."</p>

<p>The conflict is speedily joined. More than once Siegfried is
well-nigh lost; but his chance comes. The dragon exposes his
heart, and Siegfried sinks his sword into it up to the hilt. In
the moment of death, Fafner warns the young hero to beware of
him who stirred him to the fight. But Siegfried pays little heed.
The blood of the dragon bespatters his hand; it burns. Siegfried
involuntarily carries his hand to his lips. There is a wood
bird singing. Siegfried regards him with astonishment. "Almost,"
he says, "it seems as wood birds were speaking to me," and he
hearkens.</p>

<p>"Hei!" sings the wood bird; "now Siegfried owns all the
Nibelung's hoard. Let him but search the cavern, and hoard,
Tarnhelm, and Ring will make him the lord of the world!"</p>

<p>"Thanks, dearest birdling," Siegfried replies, and possesses himself
of Tarnhelm and Ring. The hoard he leaves where it was.</p>

<p>"Hei!" sings the wood bird; "Ring and Tarnhelm Siegfried
has won. Now let him not trust the treacherous tongue of the
falsest of friends!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span></p>

<p>No sooner is that warning given than Mime, who has meanwhile
been wrangling with Alberich over the division of the spoils,
creeps forward.</p>

<p>"See, thou art weary; drink of the broth I have brewed, and
take rest," he says smilingly to Siegfried. But under his breath
he is muttering, "Drink, and choke thee to death," as he pours
the draft into the drink horn and offers it.</p>

<p>"Taste thou my sword, loathsome babbler!" cries the young
hero, and strikes him dead at a blow; then pitches his body on top
of the hoard and stops up the mouth of the cave with the grinning
corpse of the dragon.</p>

<p>"Thanks, friendliest birdling! But happiness yet have I not.
Brothers and sisters hast thou; but I&mdash;am so alone; nor brother
nor sister, nor father nor mother. One comrade had I; he laid out
to catch me, and now I have slain him, perforce. Ah, birdling, find
me a comrade true!"</p>

<p>"Hei!" chatters the wood bird; "a glorious bride for Siegfried
have I. On a rocky fastness she sleeps, and guarded by fire is her
home. Who fighteth the flames wakens the maid; Br&uuml;nnhilde,
Br&uuml;nnhilde, he wins for his own!"</p>

<p>"Where'er thou fliest, follows my foot," shouts Siegfried, bubbling
with joy.</p>

<p>The scene changes. In a wild spot at the foot of a rocky mountain
Wotan, the Wanderer, desiring the success of Siegfried and
still knowing that that success involves the doom of the gods, seeks
counsel from Erda. The all-wise one refuses to answer,&mdash;refers
him to the Norns. "The Norns are waking, they wind the rope.
The Norns will give thee answer!"</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" replies the Wanderer. "Their weaving is ever in
thrall to fate. To thee I come that I may learn how to stay the
wheel that is already rolling."</p>

<p>"Ask Br&uuml;nnhilde!"</p>

<p>"In vain, All-wise One; the piercing sting of care was planted
by thee. Ruin and downfall were foretold by thee. Say to me, now,
how a god may conquer his care!"</p>

<p>"Thou art&mdash;<i>not</i> what thou hast said." No more will Erda
vouchsafe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

<p>Not what he has said! Then, surely, the gods are beyond redemption.
But not even so shall the harvest be reaped by the
Nibelungs. "Nay, to the Volsung shall be my heritage," decrees
Wotan: "to him who has known me never, though chosen by
me; to the lad of dauntless daring, though untaught by my counsel.
Pure from greed, gladdened by love-dreams, he has won the
Nibelung's Ring. Against him the curse of Alberich cannot avail."</p>

<p>While yet the Wanderer is speaking, Erda descends to endless
sleep. Dawn illumines the scene. Siegfried's bird comes fluttering
to the foreground, but, frighted by vision of the god, takes wing and
disappears. Siegfried presses on.</p>

<p>"My birdling has flown from my eyes," he remarks. "I needs
must find out the rock for myself."</p>

<p>"The way that the wood bird pointed," announces Wotan, encountering
him, "shalt thou not pass!"</p>

<p>"Ho ho! Wouldst thou stay me? Who art thou, then, that here
withstandest?"</p>

<p>"Fear the fell's defender! By my might the slumbering maid is
held enchained. He who should wake her, he who should win her,
mightless would make me forever. Go back, then, foolhardy boy!"</p>

<p>As the Wanderer speaks, the splendor spreads from the flame-girdled
rock above.</p>

<p>"Go back thyself, thou babbler! There where the fires are blazing,&mdash;to
Br&uuml;nnhilde now must I hie!" And Siegfried pushes
forward.</p>

<p>The Wanderer bars the way to the mountain: "Once already
that sword of thine, Nothung, has broken on the haft of this sacred
spear!"</p>

<p>"'Tis, then, my father's slayer!" thinks Siegfried; and nothing
loath to face that foe, he raises the new-forged sword and strikes
to pieces the All-father's spear!</p>

<p>"Fare on," says Wotan, quietly picking up the fragments, "I
cannot withstand thee."</p>

<p>The god vanishes in darkness. The hero, light-hearted, blowing
his horn, scales the cliffs, passes the fire,&mdash;wakes Br&uuml;nnhilde.
She, at first, with maidenly might struggles against his passion for
her and her growing tenderness for him. She deplores the byrnie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
shield and helm, symbols of her godhead, that he has torn from
her. But, mortal now, she surrenders to a mortal's love:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Siegfried, Siegfried, child of delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love thyself,&mdash;and turn thee from me;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Oh, bring not thine own to naught!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Siegfried:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I&mdash;love thee: didst thou but love me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine am I no more: oh, would that thou wert mine!...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waken, O maid; live in laughter:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweetest delight, be mine, be mine!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then she, with a joyful cry:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Oh, child of delight! Oh, glorious hero!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thou foolish lord of loftiest deeds!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Laughing must I love thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Laughing welcome my blindness;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Laughing let us be lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With laughter go down to death....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell, Valhalla's light-giving world:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy stately towers let fall in dust!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell, O glittering pomp of the gods!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Complete your bliss, eternal host!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now rend, ye Norns, your rope of runes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dusk of Gods in darkness arise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night of downfall dawn in mist!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And thus, turning their backs on Valhalla, and radiant with the
light of human love, the twain, laughing, face toward death.</p>

<p><b>288. The Twilight of the Gods.</b> The play opens with a prelude.
By the Valkyrie's rock sit the three Norns and sing of past, present,
and future, weaving through the night their rope of runes.
As they foretell the burning of Valhalla and the end of the gods,
the rope breaks, and the Norns disappear into the earth.</p>

<p>The sun rises, and in the first act of the play Siegfried and
Br&uuml;nnhilde enter from their cave. She sends him forth in quest
of heroic adventures in the world, giving him her horse, Grane,
and receiving from him the Ring as a pledge of his love.</p>

<p>The scene changes, and we behold the interior of the Gibichungs'
hall on the Rhine. Gunther and Gutrune, his sister, are in
converse with Hagen, their half brother,&mdash;dark and treacherous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
son of Grimhilde, their mother, and of Alberich the Nibelung,
erstwhile owner of the Ring. Hagen alone knows, it would seem,
that Siegfried has already ridden through the flames and won
Br&uuml;nnhilde. The others know merely that that hero has slain
Fafner and is lord of the Tarnhelm, hoard, and Ring. Hagen,
anxious to regain the heritage of the Nibelungs, urges marriage
on Gunther, naming Br&uuml;nnhilde as a fitting bride for him. As,
however, Siegfried alone can pass through the fire to come at her,
he proposes that Gutrune shall win Siegfried's love and induce him
to serve Gunther. Siegfried's horn is heard, and he presently enters
and is made welcome. Gutrune, at the instigation of Hagen,
brings Siegfried a potion which causes him to love her, and drives
clean out of his mind all memory of Br&uuml;nnhilde. In the madness
of his passion for Gutrune, Siegfried swears blood-brotherhood
with Gunther, and promises by the aid of the Tarnhelm to make
Br&uuml;nnhilde Gunther's wife, if only in return Gutrune shall be his.
The newly sworn "brothers" depart for Br&uuml;nnhilde's rock.</p>

<p>In the next scene we are again before the home of Br&uuml;nnhilde.
Waltraute, a Valkyrie, comes to beg Br&uuml;nnhilde to give back the
Ring to the Rhine-maidens, and so avert the doom of the gods.</p>

<p>"What, then, aileth the immortals?" cries Br&uuml;nnhilde in alarm.</p>

<p>"Since Wotan doomed thee, no more hath he sent us to war," replies
Waltraute. "No more hath he gathered the souls of the slain
about him in Valhalla. Alone he has ridden unceasing through the
world. But, one day, home he came bearing his spear all splintered
in his hand. Wordless, with a sign he bade Valhalla's heroes hew
the world ash tree in pieces and pile it like firewood around the
Hall of the Blest. And from that hour silent he sits on his throne,
about him the awe-struck gods and heroes, the war-maids cowering
at his knees. None tastes the apples of youth. To-day Wotan
remembered thee; his eye grew soft and, as dreaming, he spake:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'If once more the daughters of Rhine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should win from her finger the Ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of the load of the curse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were the world and immortals made free.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Br&uuml;nnhilde, yield up the Ring, and end all the grief of the world!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Ring?" wails Br&uuml;nnhilde. "Knowest thou what 'tis to
me? One flash of its fire outvalues all heaven's delight; for the
gleam of that Ring is Siegfried's love!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From love I never shall turn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his love they never shall rob me,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Though into ruins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valhalla's splendor should fall!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus Br&uuml;nnhilde refuses, and sends Waltraute away to take her
defiance to Valhalla.</p>

<p>But retribution is swift, for on the moment Siegfried, changed to
Gunther's shape by the Tarnhelm, comes and claims Br&uuml;nnhilde
as his bride. She resists and threatens him with the Ring. But
now Siegfried, forgetful of the past, struggles for another with his
own dear wife, overcomes her, and wrests the Ring from her. He
then commands her to go into the cave, whither, after drawing his
sword to lay between them as symbol of his loyalty to Gunther, he
follows her.</p>

<p>The second act is outside the Gibichungs' hall. It is early morning
of the next day. After a short scene in which the ever-plotting
Alberich urges Hagen to get the Ring, Siegfried returns and tells
Hagen and Gutrune of the winning of Br&uuml;nnhilde and her approach
with Gunther. Hagen calls together the vassals to welcome Gunther
and his bride. The royal pair presently arrive and are received with
loud acclaim. Straightway Br&uuml;nnhilde recognizes Siegfried (who,
however, does not know her) and, seeing the Ring on Siegfried's
finger, she asks Gunther what he has done with the ring he took
from her. His confusion reveals the truth to her, and she proclaims
that she is wedded to Siegfried and not to Gunther. Siegfried
swears on the point of Hagen's spear that her accusation is false.
She repeats it, taking the same oath. Siegfried, Gutrune, and their
vassals go out to prepare for the double wedding celebration; Gunther,
Hagen, and Br&uuml;nnhilde remaining solemnly condemn Siegfried
to death for what seems treachery to one and all. Hagen, left alone,
glories in the prospect of regaining the Ring.</p>

<p>The third act discloses an open place on the banks of the Rhine.
The three Rhine-maidens pray to the sun for the return of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
Rhine-gold. Siegfried, who has strayed from his companions on a
hunting expedition, comes to the river bank. The maidens unsuccessfully
attempt, by wiles and warnings of ill fate, to get the Ring
from him, and finally swim away, foretelling his death that very day.
Gunther, Hagen, and their vassals come to the place, and all sit
down to rest. At Hagen's suggestion Siegfried relates the story of
his life. But, lo! when he comes to the episode of his first passage
through the fire, a draft given him by Hagen restores his memory,
and innocently he tells of the waking and winning of Br&uuml;nnhilde.
All start up in amaze; Hagen stabs Siegfried in the back with his
spear, and steals away. Siegfried falls, and after a few words sung
to Br&uuml;nnhilde, whom he sees as in a vision, he dies. His body is
placed on a bier and borne away by the vassals with great pomp
and state as the sun sets.</p>

<p>In the last scene we have the interior of the Gibichungs' hall
as before. It is night. Gutrune comes from her chamber anxious
for Siegfried. Presently Hagen's voice is heard calling for torches
to light the returning hunters. He enters and, in reply to Gutrune's
questions, tells her that Siegfried has been slain by a wild boar.
Then come the vassals, bearing Siegfried's body. It is placed on a
bier in the center of the hall. Hagen claims the Ring as his right
for slaying Siegfried, but Gunther defies him to touch Gutrune's
heritage. They fight and Gunther falls. As Hagen approaches the
corpse to take the Ring, the dead Siegfried raises his arm threateningly.
All start back in horror, and just then Br&uuml;nnhilde enters
and comes down to the bier. Here, after ordering a pyre to be
built on the river bank, she sings a funeral song over Siegfried.
The body, from which she has taken the Ring, is then placed on
the pyre. Setting the Ring on her own finger, Br&uuml;nnhilde calls on
the Rhine-maidens to take it in turn from her ashes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let fire, burning this hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleanse, too, the Ring from its curse."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She applies the torch:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="ph4">THE ORIGIN AND ELEMENTS OF MYTH</span></h3>


<p><b>289. Kinds of Myth.</b> If we classify the preceding stories according
to the reason of their existence, we observe that they are
of two kinds,&mdash;explanatory and &aelig;sthetic.</p>

<p>(1) <i>Explanatory myths</i> are the outcome of na&iuml;ve guesses at the
truth, of mistaken and superstitious attempts to satisfy the curiosity
of primitive and unenlightened peoples, to unveil the mysteries of
existence, make clear the facts of the universe and the experiences
of life, to account for religious rites and social customs of which
the origin is forgotten, to teach the meaning and the history of
things. There are certain questions that nearly every child and
every savage asks: What is the world and what is man? Who
made them? What else did the maker do? and what the first
men? Whence came the commodities of life? Why do we celebrate
certain festivals, practice certain ceremonials, observe solemnities,
and partake of sacraments, and bow to this or the other god?
What is death, and what becomes of us after death? The answers
to such questions crystallized themselves gradually into stories of
the creation, of the gods, and of the heroes&mdash;forefathers of men,
but magnified, because unfamiliar, mysterious, and remote.</p>

<p>Old literatures abound in explanatory myths of so highly imaginative
a character that we moderns are tempted to read into them
meanings which probably they never possessed. For the diverse
and contradictory significations that have in recent years been proposed
for one and the same myth could not all, at any one time,
have been entertained by the myth-makers. On the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
the current explanations of certain myths are sufficiently apparent
to be probable. "To the ancients," says John Fiske,<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> "the moon
was not a lifeless body of stones and clods; it was the horned
huntress Artemis, coursing through the upper ether, or bathing
herself in the clear lake; or it was Aphrodite, protectress of lovers,
born of the sea foam in the East, near Cyprus. The clouds were
not bodies of vaporized water; they were cows, with swelling udders,
driven to the milking by Hermes, the summer wind; or great
sheep with moist fleeces, slain by the unerring arrows of Bellerophon,
the sun; or swan-maidens, flitting across the firmament;
Valkyries hovering over the battle field to receive the souls of falling
heroes; or, again, they were mighty mountains, piled one above
another, in whose cavernous recesses the divining wand of the
storm-god Thor revealed hidden treasures. The yellow-haired sun,
Ph&oelig;bus, drove westerly all day in his flaming chariot; or, perhaps,
as Meleager, retired for awhile in disgust from the sight of men;
wedded at eventide the violet light (&OElig;none, Iole) which he had
forsaken in the morning; sank as Hercules upon a blazing funeral
pyre, or, like Agamemnon, perished in a blood-stained bath; or,
as the fish-god, Dagon, swam nightly through the subterranean
waters to appear eastward again at daybreak. Sometimes Pha&euml;thon,
his rash, inexperienced son, would take the reins and drive
the solar chariot too near the earth, causing the fruits to perish,
and the grass to wither, and the wells to dry up. Sometimes, too,
the great all-seeing divinity, in his wrath at the impiety of men,
would shoot down his scorching arrows, causing pestilence to spread
over the land."</p>

<p>(2) <i>&AElig;sthetic myths</i> have their origin in the universal desire for
amusement, in the revulsion of the mind from the humdrum of
actuality. They furnish information that may not be practical, but
is delightful; they elicit emotion&mdash;sympathy, tears, and laughter&mdash;for
characters and events remote from our commonplace experience
but close to the heart of things, and near and significant and
enchanting to us in the atmosphere of imagination that embraces
severed continents, inspires the dead with life, bestows color and
breath upon the creatures of a dream, and wraps young and old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>in the wonder of hearing a new thing. The &aelig;sthetic myth, first,
removes us from the sordid world of immediate and selfish needs,
and then unrolls a vision of a world where men and things exist
simply for the purpose of delighting us. And the enduring measure
of delight which the &aelig;sthetic myth affords is the test of what we
call its <i>beauty</i>.</p>

<p>A myth, whether explanatory or &aelig;sthetic, is of unconscious
growth, almost never concocted with a view to instruction.</p>

<p>According to their subjects, &aelig;sthetic myths are either historic or
romantic. (<i>a</i>) If <i>historic</i>, they utilize events which have a skeleton
of fact. They supply flesh and sinew of divine or heroic adventure
and character, blood and breath of probability and imagination. In
historic myths the dependence of gods, heroes, and events upon
the stern necessity of an overruling power, of fate or providence,
is especially to be observed. Of this class is the Iliad of Homer.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) If <i>romantic</i>, the myths are characterized by bolder selection
or creation of fundamental events; indeed, events appear to be
chosen with a view to displaying or developing the character of
the hero. In such myths circumstances are not so important as
what the hero does with circumstances. The hero is more independent
than in the historic myth; his liberty, his choice,&mdash;in
judgment, in conduct, and in feeling,&mdash;his responsibility, are the
center of interest. In romantic myths like the Odyssey this sense
of freedom does not impel the poet to capricious use of his material.
But lesser bards than Homer have permitted their heroes to run
riot in adventures that weary the imagination and offend the
moral judgment.</p>

<p><b>290. Divisions of Inquiry.</b> We are next led to ask how these
myths came into existence, and how it is that the same myth meets
us under various forms in literatures and among peoples widely
separate in time and place. These are questions of the <i>Origin</i>
and <i>Distribution</i> of myths; and in this chapter we shall discuss
the former.</p>

<p><b>291. Elements of the Myth.</b> The myths preserved in the literatures
of many civilized nations, such as the Greek, present to the
imaginative and the moral sense aspects fraught with contradiction.
In certain myths the gods display themselves as beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
wise, and beneficent beings; in others they indulge in cruel, foolish,
and unbeautiful practices and adventures. These contradictory
elements have been called the reasonable and the senseless.
A myth of Mother Earth (Demeter) mourning the loss of her
daughter, the Springtide, is reasonable; a myth of Demeter
devouring, in a fit of abstraction, the shoulder of the boy Pelops,
and replacing it with ivory, is capricious, apparently senseless.
"It is this silly, senseless, and savage element," as Max M&uuml;ller
says, "that makes mythology the puzzle which men have so long
found it."</p>

<p><b>292. Reasonable Myths.</b> If myths were always reasonable, it
would not be difficult to reach an agreement concerning some way
by which they may have come into existence.</p>

<p><i>Imagination.</i> If we assume that the peoples who invented these
stories of supernatural beings and events had, with due allowance
for the discrepancy in mental development, imaginations like our
own, there is nothing in the history of reasonable myths to baffle
our understanding. For, at the present time, not only children
and simple-minded men, like sailors or mountaineers, but cultivated
men of ordinary poetic sensibility, bestow attributes of life
upon inanimate things and abstract ideas. The sun is nowadays
thirsty, the ship is a woman, the clouds threaten, charity suffereth
long, the waves are angry, time will tell, and death swallows all
things. The sun still rises, and, as Mr. Jasper maintains, "do
move." By personification we, every day, bestow the attributes of
human beings upon inanimate nature, animals, and abstractions.
By our metaphors we perpetuate and diffuse the poetic illusion;
we talk not perhaps of the arrows of Apollo, but of a sunstroke;
our poetry abounds in symbols of the moon, of the swift-wing&egrave;d
wind, of the ravening sea. In our metonymies we use the sign
for the thing signified, the crown for the king, the flag for the
honor of the country; and the crown and the flag are to-day possessed
of attributes and individuality just as efficient as those that
endowed the golden handmaids of Vulcan or the eagle of Jove.
Nor is hyperbole any less in use among us than it was among the
ancients; we glorify our political heroes with superlatives, they
dignified theirs with divinity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Belief.</i> But this resemblance in habits of imagination, while
it may help us to appreciate the mental condition of primitive
peoples, accentuates the distinction between our imagination and
theirs. They, at some time or other, believed in these personifications.
We do not believe. But their belief is easier to comprehend
when we remember that the myths of savages are not a deliberate
invention of any one individual, but are constructed by generations
of people, and that many of them cluster about beings who were
actually worshiped. Among primitive nations the sense of awe in
the presence of magnificent objects of nature&mdash;mountains, the
sky, the sun, the sea&mdash;is universal. It springs from the fact that
savages do not deem themselves superior to nature. They are not
conscious of souls whose flight is higher than that of nature. On
the contrary, since sun, sea, and winds move, the savage invests
them with free will and personality like man's. In proportion, however,
as their size is grander or their movement more tremendous,
these objects must be possessed of freedom, personality, and power
exceeding those of man. Why, then, should not the savage believe,
of beings worthy of worship and fear and gratitude, all and more
than all that is accredited to man? Why not confer upon them
human and superhuman passions and powers? If we were living,
like the Greek of old, close to the heart of nature, such personification
of natural powers would be more easy for us to appreciate.</p>

<p>"If for us also, as for the Greek," says Ruskin,<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> "the sunrise
means daily restoration to the sense of passionate gladness and
of perfect life&mdash;if it means the thrilling of new strength through
every nerve,&mdash;the shedding over us of a better peace than the
peace of night, in the power of the dawn,&mdash;and the purging of
evil vision and fear by the baptism of its dew;&mdash;if the sun itself
is an influence, to us also, of spiritual good,&mdash;and becomes thus
in reality, not in imagination, to us also, a spiritual power,&mdash;we
may then soon overpass the narrow limit of conception which kept
that power impersonal, and rise with the Greek to the thought of
an angel who rejoiced as a strong man to run his course, whose
voice, calling to life and to labor, rang round the earth, and whose
going forth was to the ends of heaven."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p>
<p>Regarding thus the religious condition of the savage, we may
comprehend the existence of myths and his acceptance of them.</p>

<p><b>293. Unreasonable Myths.</b> But he would maintain this attitude
of acceptance only in the matter of good and beneficent gods and
of righteous or reasonable myths.</p>

<p>For how could a human being believe of the god whom he
worshiped and revered, deeds and attributes more silly and more
shameful than man can conceive of his fellow man? When, therefore,
we find senseless and shameless myths existing side by side
with stories of the justice and righteousness of the same god, we
must conclude that, since the worshiper could not believe both
sets of attributes, he preserved his religious attitude before the
good god only by virtue of rejecting the senseless myth.</p>

<p>A man's religious belief would assist him to entertain only the
reasonable myths. How, then, did the senseless and cruel stories
come into existence? And were they ever believed?</p>

<p>There are many answers to these questions. They may, however,
be classified according to the theory of civilization that they assume.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Theory of Deterioration</i>, or Human Depravity,
man, although he had in the beginning knowledge of common
facts, pure moral and religious ideas, and true poetic conceptions,
has forgotten, with the lapse of time, the significance of
words, facts, men, and events, adopted corrupt moral and religious
notions, and given license to the diseased imagining of untrue and
unlovely conceptions.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Theory of Improvement</i>, or Progress, man,
beginning with crude dreams and fancies about experience, life,
the world, and God, has gradually developed truer and higher
conceptions of his own nature, of his relation to the world about
him, of duty, of art, and of religion.</p>

<p><b>294. Theory of Deterioration.</b> Let us consider first the interpretations
of mythology that assume a backward tendency in early
civilization. They are:</p>

<p>(1) The <i>Historical</i>, or better called after its author, Euhemerus
(<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 316), the <i>Euhemeristic</i>. This explanation assumes that
myths of the gods are exaggerated adventures of historic individuals,
chieftains, medicine men, heroes; and that supernatural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
events are distortions of natural but wonderful occurrences. In
fact, it attributes to our forefathers a disease of the memory which
prompted them to pervert facts. Jupiter, Odin, and Hercules were
accordingly men who, after death, had been glorified, then deified,
then invested with numerous characteristics and adventures appropriate
to their exalted conditions of existence.</p>

<p>The custom of worshiping ancestors, still existent in China and
other countries, is adduced in support of this method of investigating
myths, and it is undoubtedly true that the method explains the
origin and growth of some myths. But it accounts rather for the
reasonable than the senseless element of mythical adventure, while
it fails to show how savages come to exaggerate their heroes into
beings entirely out of the realm of that actual experience which
is the basis of the historical assumption.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Philological Interpretation</i><a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> assumes also a disease of
the memory by reason of which men misunderstand and confuse
the meanings of words, and misapply the words themselves. Professor
Max M&uuml;ller calls this affection a disease of language. In
ancient languages every such word as <i>day</i>, <i>night</i>, <i>earth</i>, <i>sun</i>, <i>spring</i>,
<i>dawn</i>, had an ending expressive of gender, which naturally produced
the corresponding idea of sex. These objects accordingly
became in the process of generations not only persons, but male
and female. As, also, the phrases expressing the existence or the
activity of these natural objects lost their ancient signification
under new colloquial coloring, primitive and simple statements of
natural events acquired the garb and dignity of elaborate and often
incongruous narratives, no longer about natural events, but about
persons. Ancient language may, for instance, have said <i>sunrise</i>
follows the <i>dawn</i>. The word for sun was masculine; the word for
dawn, feminine. In time the sentence came to mean, Apollo, the
god of the sun, <i>chases</i> Daphne, the maiden of the glowing dawn.
But the word, <i>Daphne</i>, meant also a laurel that burned easily,
hence might readily be devoted to the god of the sun. So Daphne,
the maiden, assuming the form of Daphne, the laurel, escaped the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>pursuit of her ardent lover, by becoming the tree sacred to his
worship.<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> The merit of the philological method is, that, tracing
the name of a mythical character through kindred languages, it
frequently ascertains for us the family of the myth, brings to light
kindred forms of the myth, discovers in what language the name
was born, and sometimes, giving us the original meaning of the
divine name, "throws light on the legend of the bearer of the
name and on its origin and first home."<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p>But unfortunately there is very often no agreement among
scholars about the original meaning of the names of mythical
beings. The same name is frequently explained in half a dozen
different ways. The same deity is reduced by different interpreters
to half a dozen elements of nature. A certain goddess represents
now the upper air, now light, now lightning, and yet again clouds.
Naturally the attempts at construing her adventures must terminate
in correspondingly dissimilar and unconvincing results. In
fine, the philological explanation assumes as its starting point masculine
and feminine names for objects of nature. It does not
attempt to show how an object like the ocean came to be male
and not female, or how it came to be a person at all. And this
latter, in studying the origin of myths, is what should first be ascertained.
We must not, however, fall into the error of supposing
that the philologists look for the origin and growth of all myths
in words and the diseases of words. Max M&uuml;ller grants that mythology
does not always create its own heroes, but sometimes lays
hold of real history. He insists that mythologists should bear in
mind that there may be in every mythological riddle elements
which resist etymological analysis, for the simple reason that their
origin was not etymological, but historical.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Allegorical Interpretation</i> is akin to the philological in
its results. It leads us to explain myths as embodiments in symbolic
guise of hidden meaning: of physical, chemical, or astronomical
facts; or of moral, religious, philosophical truth. The stories
would at first exist as allegories, but in process of time would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>come to be understood literally. Thus Cronus, who devours his
own children, is identified with the power that the Greeks called
Chronos (Time), which may truly be said to destroy whatever it
has brought into existence. The story of Io is interpreted in a
similar manner. Io is the moon, and Argus the starry sky, which,
as it were, keeps sleepless watch over her. The fabulous wanderings
of Io represent the continual revolutions of the moon. This
method of explanation rests upon the assumption that the men
who made the allegories were proficient in physics, chemistry,
astronomy, etc., and clever in allegory; but that, for some unknown
reason, their descendants becoming stupid, knowledge as
well as wit deserted the race. In some cases the myth was, without
doubt, from the first an allegory; but where the myth was
consciously fashioned as an allegory, in all probability it was preserved
as such. It is not, however, likely that allegories of deep
scientific or philosophical import were invented by savages. Where
the myth has every mark of great antiquity,&mdash;is especially silly
and senseless and savage,&mdash;it is safe to believe that any profound
allegorical meaning, read into it, is the work of men of a later
generation, who thus attempted to make reasonable the divine and
heroic narratives which they could not otherwise justify and of
whose existence they were ashamed. We find, moreover, in some
cases a great variety of symbolic explanations of the same myth,
one with as great claim to credence as another, since they spring
from the same source,&mdash;the caprice or fancy of the expounder.</p>

<p>Among the ancients Theagenes of Rhegium, six hundred years
before Christ, suggested the allegorical theory and method of
interpretation. In modern times he has been supported by Lord
Bacon, whose "Wisdom of the Ancients" treats myths as "elegant
and instructive fables," and by many Germans, especially Professor
Creuzer.</p>

<p>(4) <i>The Theological Interpretation.</i> This premises that mankind,
either in general or through some chosen nationality, received
from God an original revelation of pure religious ideas, and that,
with the systematic and continued perversion of the moral sense,
this knowledge of truth, morality, and spiritual religion fell into
corruption. So in Greek mythology the attributes of the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
gods would be imperfect irradiations of the attributes of the one
God. A more limited conception is, that all mythological legends
are derived from the narratives of Scripture, though the real facts
have been disguised and altered. Thus, Deucalion is only another
name for Noah, Hercules for Samson, Arion for Jonah, etc. Sir
Walter Raleigh, in his "History of the World," says, "Jubal,
Tubal, and Tubal-Cain were Mercury, Vulcan, and Apollo, inventors
of pasturage, smithing, and music. The dragon which kept
the golden apples was the serpent that beguiled Eve. Nimrod's
tower was the attempt of the giants against heaven." There are
doubtless many curious coincidences like these, but the theory
cannot, without extravagance, be pushed so far as to account for
any great proportion of the stories. For many myths antedate the
scriptural narratives of which they are said to be copies; many
more, though resembling the scriptural stories, originated among
peoples ignorant of the Hebrew Bible. The theory rests upon two
unproved assumptions: one, that all nations have had a chance to
be influenced by the same set of religious doctrines; the other,
that God made his revelation in the beginning once for all, and
has done nothing to help man toward righteousness since then.
The theological theory has been advocated by Voss and other
Germans in the seventeenth century, by Jacob Bryant in 1774,
and in this century most ably by Gladstone.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p><b>295.</b> We are now ready for the explanation of myth-making
based upon the <b>Theory of Progress</b>. This is best stated by Mr.
Andrew Lang,<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> whose argument is, when possible, given in his
own language. To the question how the senseless element got into
myths, the advocates of this theory answer that it was in the minds
and in the social condition of the savages who invented the myths.
But since we cannot put ourselves back in history thousands of
years to examine the habits of thought and life of early savages,
we are constrained to examine whether anywhere nowadays there
may exist "any stage of the human intellect in which these divine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>adventures and changes of men into animals, trees, stars, this belief
in seeing and talking with the dead, are regarded as possible incidents
of daily human life." As the result of such scientific investigation,
numerous races of savages have been found who at this
present day accept and believe just such silly and senseless elements
of myth as puzzle us and have puzzled many of the cultivated
ancients who found them in their inherited mythologies. The
theory of development is, then, that "the savage and senseless
element in mythology is, for the most part, a legacy from ancestors
of civilized races who, at the time that they invented the senseless
stories, were in an intellectual state not higher than that of our
contemporary Australians, Bushmen, Red Indians, the lower races
of South America, and other worse than barbaric people of the
nineteenth century." But what are the characteristics of the mental
state of our contemporary savages? First and foremost, <i>curiosity</i>
that leads them to inquire into the causes of things; and
second, <i>credulity</i> that impels them to invent or to accept childish
stories that may satisfy their untutored experience. We find, moreover,
that savages nowadays think of everything around them as
having life and the parts and passions of persons like themselves.
"The sky, sun, wind, sea, earth, mountains, trees, regarded as
persons, are mixed up with men, beasts, stars, and stones on the
same level of personality and life." The forces of nature, animals,
and things have for these Polynesians and Bushmen the same
powers and attributes that men have; and in their opinion men
have the following attributes:</p>

<p>"1. Relationship to animals and ability to be transformed, and
to transform others, into animals and other objects.</p>

<p>"2. Magical accomplishments, such as power to call up ghosts,
or to visit ghosts and the region of the dead; power over the
seasons, the sun, moon, stars, weather, and so forth."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>The stories of savages to-day abound in adventures based upon
qualities and incidents like these. If these stories should survive in
the literature of these nations after the nations have been civilized,
they would appear senseless and silly and cruel to the descendants
of our contemporary savages. In like manner, "as the ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>Greeks, Egyptians, and Norsemen advanced in civilization, their
religious thought and artistic taste were shocked by myths which
were preserved by local priesthoods, or in ancient poems, or in
popular religious ceremonials.... We may believe that ancient
and early tribes framed gods like themselves in action and in
experience, and that the allegorical element in myths is the addition
of later peoples who had attained to purer ideas of divinity,
yet dared not reject the religion of their ancestors."<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> The senseless
element in the myths would, by this theory, be, for the most
part, a "survival." Instead, then, of deteriorating, the races that
invented senseless myths are, with ups and downs of civilization,
intellectually and morally improved, to such extent that they desire
to repudiate the senseless element in their mythical and religious
traditions, or to explain it as reasonable by way of allegory. This
method of research depends upon the science of mind&mdash;psychology,
and the science of man&mdash;anthropology. It may be called
the <i>Anthropological Method</i>. The theory is that of "survival."</p>

<p>According to this theory many of the puzzling elements of myth
resolve themselves into survivals of primitive philosophy, science,
or history. From the first proceed the cruder systems of physical
and spiritual evolution, the generations of gods and the other-world
of ghosts; from the second, the cruder attempts at explaining the
phenomena of the natural and animal world by endowing them
with human and frequently magical powers; from the third, the
narratives invented to account for the sanctity of certain shrines
and rituals, and for tribal customs and ceremonials, the origin of
which had been forgotten. These last are known as <i>&aelig;tiological</i>
myths; they pretend to assign the <i>ait&iacute;a</i>, or <i>reason</i>, why Delphi,
for instance, should have the oracle of Apollo, or why the ritual of
Demeter should be celebrated at Eleusis and in a certain dramatic
manner.</p>

<p>It is of course probable that occasionally the questionable element
of the myth originated in germs other than savage curiosity
and credulity: for instance, in the adventures of some great hero,
or in a disease of language by which statements about objects came
to be understood as stories about persons, or perhaps in a conscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>allegory, or, even, in the perversion of some ancient purer form of
moral or religious truth. But, in general, the root of myth-making
is to be found in the mental and social condition of primitive man,
the confused personality that he extended to his surroundings, and
the belief in magical powers that he conferred upon those of his
tribesmen who were shrewdest and most influential. This mental
condition of the myth-maker should be premised in all scientific
explanations of myth-making.</p>

<p>The transition is easy from the personification of the elements
of nature and the acceptance of fictitious history to the notion of
supernatural beings presiding over, and governing, the different
objects of nature&mdash;air, fire, water, the sun, moon, and stars, the
mountains, forests, and streams&mdash;or possessing marvelous qualities
of action, passion, virtue, foresight, spirituality, and vice.</p>

<p>The Greeks, whose imagination was lively, peopled all nature with
such invisible inhabitants and powers. In Greece, says Wordsworth,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>The phases of significance and beauty through which the physical
or natural myth may develop are expressed with poetic grace
by Ruskin, in his "Queen of the Air."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> The reader must, however,
guard against the supposition that any myth has sprung into existence
fully equipped with physical, religious, and moral import.
Ruskin himself says, "To the mean person the myth always meant
little; to the noble person, much." Accordingly, as we know, to
the savage the myth was savage; to the devotee it became religious;
to the artist, beautiful; to the philosopher, recondite and
significant&mdash;in the course of centuries.</p>

<p>"If we seek," says Ruskin, "to ascertain the manner in which
the story first crystallized into its shape, we shall find ourselves
led back generally to one or other of two sources&mdash;either to actual
historical events, represented by the fancy under figures personifying
them, or else to natural phenomena similarly endowed with life
by the imaginative power, usually more or less under the influence
of terror. The historical myths we must leave the masters of
history to follow; they, and the events they record, being yet involved
in great, though attractive and penetrable, mystery. But
the stars and hills and storms are with us now, as they were with
others of old; and it only needs that we look at them with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>earnestness of those childish eyes to understand the first words
spoken of them by the children of men. And then, in all the
most beautiful and enduring myths, we shall find not only a literal
story of a real person&mdash;not only a parallel imagery of moral principle&mdash;but
an underlying worship of natural phenomena, out of
which both have sprung, and in which both forever remain rooted.
Thus, from the real sun, rising and setting; from the real atmosphere,
calm in its dominion of unfading blue and fierce in its
descent of tempest&mdash;the Greek forms first the idea of two entirely
personal and corporeal gods (Apollo and Athena), whose limbs are
clothed in divine flesh, and whose brows are crowned with divine
beauty; yet so real that the quiver rattles at their shoulder, and
the chariot bends beneath their weight. And, on the other hand,
collaterally with these corporeal images, and never for one instant
separated from them, he conceives also two omnipresent spiritual
influences, of which one illuminates, as the sun, with a constant
fire, whatever in humanity is skillful and wise; and the other, like
the living air, breathes the calm of heavenly fortitude and strength
of righteous anger into every human breast that is pure and brave.</p>

<p>"Now, therefore, in nearly every [natural] myth of importance, ...
you have to discern these three structural parts&mdash;the root
and the two branches. The root, in physical existence, sun, or sky,
or cloud, or sea; then the personal incarnation of that, becoming
a trusted and companionable deity, with whom you may walk hand
in hand, as a child with its brother or its sister; and lastly, the
moral significance of the image, which is in all the great myths
eternally and beneficently true."</p>

<p>What Ruskin calls, above, the historical myth may be the euhemeristic
transformation of real events and personages, as of a flood
and those concerned in it; or it may be the &aelig;tiological invention
of a story to account for rituals of which the origin has been forgotten,
as of the Dionysiac revels, with their teaching of liberation
from the sordid limits of mortality. In either case, especially the
latter, the imaginative and moral significance of the historical myth
has in general developed with the advance of civilization.</p>

<p>Myth, in fine, whether natural, historical, or spiritual, "is not to
be regarded as mere error and folly, but as an interesting product<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
of the human mind. It is sham history, the fictitious narrative of
events that never happened."<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> But that is not the full statement of
the case. Myth is also actual history of early and imperfect stages
of thought and belief; it is the true narrative of unenlightened
observation, of infantine gropings after truth. Whatever reservations
scholars may make on other points, most of them will concur
in these: that some myths came into existence by a "disease of
language"; that some were invented to explain names of nations
and of places, and some to explain the existence of fossils and bones
that suggested prehistoric animals and men; that many were invented
to gratify the ancestral pride of chieftains and clans and
to justify the existence of religious and tribal ceremonials, and
the common cult of departed souls, and that very many obtained
consistency and form as explanations of the phenomena of nature,
as expressions of the reverence felt for the powers of nature, and
as personifications, in general, of the passions and the ideals of
primitive mankind.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<span class="ph4">THE DISTRIBUTION OF MYTHS</span></h3>


<p><b>296. Theories of Resemblance.</b> Several theories of the appearance
of the same explanatory or &aelig;sthetic myth under various
guises, in lands remote one from another, have been advanced;
but none of them fully unveils the mystery. The difficulty lies
not so much in accounting for the similarity of thought or material
in different stories, as for the resemblance in isolated incidents and
in the arrangement of incidents or plot. The principal theories
of the distribution of myths are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) That the resemblances between the myths of different nations
are purely <i>accidental</i>. This theory leaves us no wiser than we were.</p>

<p>(2) That the stories have been <i>borrowed</i> by one nation from
another. This will account for exchange only between nations
historically acquainted with each other. It will not account for
the existence of the same arrangement of incidents in a Greek
myth and in a Polynesian romance.</p>

<p>(3) That all myths, if traced chronologically backward and
geographically from land to land, will be found <i>to have originated</i>
<i>in India</i>.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> This theory fails to account for numerous stories current
among the modern nationalities of Europe, of Africa, and of
India itself. It leaves also unexplained the existence of certain
myths in Egypt many centuries before India had any known history:
such as, in all probability, the Egyptian myth of Osiris.
The theory, therefore, is open to the objection made to the theory
of borrowing.</p>

<p>(4) That similar myths are based upon <i>historical traditions</i>
similar in various countries or inherited from some mother country.
But, although some historical myths may have descended from
a mother race, it has already been demonstrated (&sect; 294, (1)) that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>the historical (euhemeristic) hypothesis is inadequate. It is, moreover,
not likely that many historical incidents, like those related
in the Iliad and the Odyssey, happened in the same order and
as actual history in Asia Minor, Ithaca, Persia, and Norway. But
we find myths containing such incidents in all these countries.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>(5) That the Aryan tribes (from which the Indians, Persians,
Phrygians, Greeks, Romans, Germans, Norsemen, Russians, and
Celts are descended) "started from a common center" in the
highlands of Northern India, "and that from their ancient home
they must have carried away, if not the developed myth, yet the
quickening germ from which might spring leaves and fruits, varying
in form and hue according to the soil to which it should be
committed and the climate under which the plant might reach
maturity."<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Against this theory it may be urged that stories having
only the undeveloped germ or idea in common would not,
with any probability, after they had been developed independently
of each other, possess the remarkable resemblance in details that
many widely separated myths display. Moreover, the assumption
of this common stock considers only Aryan tribes: it ignores
Africans, Mongolians, American Indians, and other peoples whose
myths resemble the Aryan, but are not traceable to the same original
germ. The <i>Aryan germ-theory</i> has, however, the merit of
explaining resemblances between many myths of different Aryan
nations.</p>

<p>(6) That the existence of similar incidents or situations is to be
explained as resulting from the common facts of human thought,
experience, and sentiment. This may be called the <i>psychological</i>
<i>theory</i>. It was entertained by Grimm, and goes hand in hand
with the anthropological, or "survivalist," explanation of the elements
of myth. "In the long history of mankind," says Mr.
Andrew Lang, "it is impossible to deny that stories may conceivably
have spread from a single center, and been handed on
from races like the Indo-European and Semitic to races as far
removed from them in every way as the Zulus, the Australians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>the Eskimos, the natives of the South Sea Islands. But while the
possibility of the diffusion of myths by borrowing and transmission
must be allowed for, the hypothesis of the origin of myths in the
savage state of the intellect supplies a ready explanation of their
wide diffusion." Many products of early art&mdash;clay bowls and
stone weapons&mdash;are peculiar to no one national taste or skill,
they are what might have been expected of <i>human</i> conditions
and intelligence. "Many myths may be called 'human' in this
sense. They are the rough product of the early human mind, and
are not yet characterized by the differentiations of race and culture.
Such myths might spring up anywhere among untutored
men, and anywhere might survive into civilized literature."<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>The distribution of myth, like its origin, is inexplicable by any
one theory. The discovery of racial families and of family traditions
narrows the problem, but does not solve it. The existence of
the same story in unrelated nationalities remains a perplexing fact,
towards the explanation of which the theories of "borrowing" and
of "similar historic tradition," while plausible, are but unsubstantiated
contributions. And until we possess the earliest records of
those unrelated nationalities that have similar myths, or until we
discover monuments and log books of some commercial nation that
in prehistoric times circumnavigated the globe and deposited on
remote shores and islands the seeds of the parent mythic plant, we
must accept as our only scientific explanation the psychological, or
so-called <i>human</i>, theory:&mdash;Given similar mental condition with
similar surroundings, similar imaginative products, called myths,
will result.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<span class="ph4">THE PRESERVATION OF MYTHS</span></h3>


<p><b>297. Traditional History.</b> Before the introduction of writing,
myths were preserved in popular traditions, in the sacred ceremonials
of colleges of priests, in the narratives chanted by families of
minstrels or by professional bards wandering from village to village
or from court to court, and in occasional hymns sung by privileged
harpists, like Demodocus of Ph&aelig;acia,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> in honor of a chieftain, an
ancestor, or a god. Many of these early bards are mere names to
us. Most of them are probably as mythical as the songs with which
they are accredited. The following is a brief account of mythical
prophets, of mythical musicians and poets, and of the actual poets
and historians who recorded the mythologies from which English
literature draws its classical myths,&mdash;the Greek, the Roman, the
Norse, and the German.</p>

<p><b>298. In Greece.</b> (1) <i>Mythical Prophets.</i> To some of the oldest
bards was attributed the gift of prophecy. Indeed, nearly every
expedition of mythology was accompanied by one of these seers,
priests, or "medicine men," as we might call them.</p>

<p><i>Melampus</i> was the first Greek said to be endowed with prophetic
powers. Before his house there stood an oak tree containing a serpent's
nest. The old serpents were killed by the slaves, but Melampus
saved the young ones. One day when he was asleep under the
oak, the serpents licked his ears with their tongues, enabling him to
understand the language of birds and creeping things.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> At one time
his enemies seized and imprisoned him. But Melampus, in the silence
of the night, heard from the woodworms in the timbers that the supports
of the house were nearly eaten through and the roof would
soon fall in. He told his captors. They took his warning, escaped
destruction, rewarded the prophet, and held him in high honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span></p>

<p>Other famous soothsayers were Amphiara&uuml;s, who took part in
the War of the Seven against Thebes; Calchas, who accompanied
the Greeks during the Trojan War; Helenus and Cassandra, of
King Priam's family, who prophesied for the Trojan forces; Tiresias,
the blind prophet of Thebes; and Mopsus, who attended the
Argonauts. The stories of these expeditions are given in preceding
chapters.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Mythical Musicians and Poets.</i> Since the poets of antiquity
sang their stories or hymns to an accompaniment of their own upon
the harp or lyre, they were skilled in the art of music as well as in
that of verse.</p>

<p><i>Orpheus</i>, whose adventures have been narrated, passes in tradition
for the oldest of Greek lyrists, and the special favorite, even
the son, of the god Apollo, patron of musicians. This Thracian
bard is said to have taught mysterious truths concerning the origin
of things and the immortality of the soul. But the fragments of
Orphic hymns which are attributed to him are probably the work
of philosophers of a much later period in Greek literature.</p>

<p>Another Thracian bard, <i>Thamyris</i>, is said in his presumption to
have challenged the Muses to a trial of skill. Conquered in the contest,
he was deprived of his sight. To <i>Mus&aelig;us</i>, the son of Orpheus,
was attributed a hymn on the Eleusinian mysteries, and other sacred
poems and oracles. Milton couples his name with that of Orpheus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But, O sad Virgin! that thy power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might raise Mus&aelig;us from his bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such notes as, warbled to the string,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made Hell grant what love did seek.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Other legendary bards or musicians were Linus, Marsyas, and
Amphion.</p>

<p>(3) <i>The Poets of Mythology.</i> <i>Homer</i>, from whose poems of the
Iliad and Odyssey we have taken the chief part of our chapters on
the Trojan War and the return of the Grecians, is almost as mythical
a personage as the heroes he celebrates. The traditionary story
is that he was a wandering minstrel, blind and old, who traveled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>from place to place singing his lays to the music of his harp, in the
courts of princes or the cottages of peasants,&mdash;a dependent upon
the voluntary offerings of his hearers. Byron calls him "the blind
old man of Scio's rocky isle"; and a well-known epigram, alluding
to the uncertainty of the fact of his birthplace, runs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Seven wealthy towns contend for Homer dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which the living Homer begged his bread.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These seven places were Smyrna, Chios (now Scio), Colophon,
Ithaca, Pylos, Argos, and Athens.</p>

<p>Modern scholars have doubted whether the Homeric poems are
the work of any single mind. This uncertainty arises, in part, from
the difficulty of believing that poems of such length could have
been committed to writing in the age usually assigned to these,
when materials capable of transmitting long productions were not
yet in use. On the other hand, it is asked how poems of such
length could have been handed down from age to age by means of
the memory alone. This question is answered by the statement
that there was a professional body of men whose business it was to
commit to memory and rehearse for pay the national and patriotic
legends.</p>

<p>Pisistratus of Athens ordered a commission of scholars (about
537 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) to collect and revise the Homeric poems; and it is probable
that at that time certain passages of the Iliad and Odyssey, as
we now have them, were interpolated. Beside the Iliad and the
Odyssey, many other epics passed in antiquity under Homer's
name. The so-called Homeric Hymns to the gods, which were composed
by various poets after the death of Homer, are a source
of valuable information concerning the attributes of the divinities
addressed.</p>

<p>The date assigned to Homer, on the authority of Herodotus, is
850 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The preservation and further fashioning of myths fell, after
Homer's time, into the hands of the Rhapsodists, who chanted epic
songs, and of the Cyclic poets, who elaborated into various epic <i>circles</i>,
or completed wholes, neglected traditions of the Trojan War.
Among these cyclic poems were the Cyprian Lays, which related
the beginnings of the Trojan War and the first nine years of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
siege, thus leading up to the Iliad; the &AElig;thiopis, which continued
the Iliad and told of the death of Achilles; the Little Iliad and the
Iliupersis, which narrated the fall of Troy and magnified the exploits
of Ajax and Philoctetes; and the Nostoi, or Home-Comings, which
told the adventures of various Greek heroes during the period of
ten years between the end of the Iliad and the beginning of the
Odyssey. Most of these poems were once attributed to Homer.
They are all lost, but the names of some of their authors survive.
There was also a cycle which told of the two wars against Thebes.</p>

<p><i>Hesiod</i> is, like Homer, one of the most important sources of our
knowledge of Greek mythology. He is thought by some to have
been a contemporary of Homer, but concerning the relative dates
of the two poets there is no certainty. Hesiod was born in Ascra
in B&oelig;otia; he spent his youth as a shepherd on Mount Helicon,
his manhood in the neighborhood of Corinth, and wrote two great
poems, the Works and Days, and the Theogony, or Genealogy of
the Gods. From the former we obtain a connected account of Greek
traditions concerning the primitive commodities of life, the arts of
agriculture and navigation, the sacred calendar, and the various prehistoric
ages. From the latter poem we learn the Greek mythology
of the creation of the world, the family of the gods, their wars,
and their attitude toward primeval man. While Hesiod may have
composed his works at a somewhat later period than Homer, it is
noteworthy that his stories of the gods have more of the savage
or senseless element than those attributed to Homer. The artist,
or artists, of the Iliad and the Odyssey seem to have refined the
stories into poetic gold; Hesiod has gathered them in the ore,
like so many specimens for a museum.</p>

<p>A company of <i>Lyric Poets</i>, of whom Stesichorus (620 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>),
Alc&aelig;us (611 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), Sappho (610 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), Arion (600 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), Simonides
of Ceos (556 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), Ibycus (540 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), Anacreon (530 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), and
Pindar (522 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) are the most prominent, have contributed much
to our knowledge of mythology. They have left us hymns to the
gods, references to mythical heroes, and accounts of more or less
pathetic legendary adventures.</p>

<p>Of the works of <i>Sappho</i> few fragments remain, but they establish
her claim to eminent poetical genius. Her story is frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
alluded to. Being passionately in love with a beautiful youth
named Phaon, and failing to obtain a return of affection, she is
said to have thrown herself from the promontory of Leucadia
into the sea, under a superstition that those who should take
that "Lover's Leap" would, if not destroyed, be cured of their
love.</p>

<p>Of <i>Arion</i> the greatest work was a dithyramb or choral hymn to
the god of wine. It is said that his music and song were of such
sweetness as to charm the monsters of the sea; and that when
thrown overboard on one occasion by avaricious seamen, he was
borne safely to land by an admiring dolphin. Spenser represents
Arion, mounted on his dolphin, accompanying the train of Neptune
and Amphitrite:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then was there heard a most celestial sound<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of dainty music, which did next ensue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Before the spouse: that was Arion crowned<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who, playing on his harp, unto him drew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The ears and hearts of all that goodly crew;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That even yet the dolphin which him bore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through the &AElig;gean seas from pirates' view,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stood still by him astonished at his lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the raging seas for joy forgot to roar.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Simonides</i> was one of the most prolific of the early poets of
Greece, but only a few fragments of his compositions have descended
to us. He wrote hymns, triumphal odes, and elegies,
and in the last species of composition he particularly excelled.
His genius was inclined to the pathetic; none could touch with
truer effect the chords of human sympathy. The Lamentation
of Dana&euml;, the most important of the fragments which remain of
his poetry, is based upon the tradition that Dana&euml; and her infant
son were confined by order of her father Acrisius in a chest and
set adrift on the sea. The myth of her son, Perseus, has already
been narrated.</p>

<p>Myths received their freest and perhaps most ideal treatment
at the hands of the greatest lyric poet of Greece, <i>Pindar</i> (522 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>).
In his hymns and songs of praise to gods and in his odes composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>for the victors in the national athletic contests, he was accustomed
to use the mythical exploits of Greek heroes as a text from which
to draw morals appropriate to the occasion.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<p>The three great <i>Tragic Poets</i> of Greece have handed down to
us a wealth of mythological material. From the plays of <i>&AElig;schylus</i>
(525 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) we gather, among other noble lessons, the fortunes of
the family of Agamemnon, the narrative of the expedition against
Thebes, the sufferings of Prometheus, benefactor of men. In
the tragedies of <i>Sophocles</i> (495 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) we have a further account
of the family of Agamemnon, myths of &OElig;dipus of Thebes and
his children, stories connected with the Trojan War, and the last
adventure and the death of Hercules. Of the dramas of <i>Euripides</i>
(480 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) there remain to us seventeen, in which are found
stories of the daughters of Agamemnon, the rare and beautiful
narrative of Alcestis, and the adventures of Medea. All of these
stories have been recounted in their proper places.</p>

<p>The <i>Comedies of Aristophanes</i>, also, are replete with matters of
mythological import.</p>

<p>Of the later poets of mythology, only two need be mentioned
here,&mdash;<i>Apollonius</i> of Rhodes (194 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), who wrote in frigid style
the story of Jason's Voyage for the Golden Fleece; and <i>Theocritus</i>
of Sicily (270 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), whose rural idyls are at once charmingly
natural and romantic.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>(4) <i>Historians of Mythology.</i> The earliest narrators in prose
of the myths, legends and genealogies of Greece lived about
600 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Herodotus, the "father of history" (484 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), embalms
various myths in his account of the conflicts between Asia and
Greece. Apollodorus (140 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) gathers the legends of Greece
later incorporated in the Library of Greek Mythology. That
delightful traveler, Pausanias, makes special mention, in his Tour
of Greece, of the sacred customs and legends that had maintained
themselves as late as his time (160 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>). Lucian, in his Dialogues
of the Gods and Dialogues of the Dead, awakens "inextinguishable
laughter" by his satire on ancient faith and fable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span></p>

<p><b>299. Roman Poets of Mythology.</b> <i>Virgil</i>, called also by his
surname, Maro, from whose poem of the &AElig;neid we have taken
the story of &AElig;neas, was one of the great poets who made the age
of the Roman emperor, Augustus, celebrated. Virgil was born in
Mantua in the year 70 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> His great poem is ranked next to
those of Homer, in that noble class of poetical composition, the
epic. Virgil is inferior to Homer in originality and invention.
The &AElig;neid, written in an age of culture and science, lacks that
charming atmosphere of belief which invests the na&iuml;ve, or <i>popular</i>,
epic. The myths concerning the founding of Rome, which Virgil
has received from earlier writers, he has here fused into a <i>literary</i>
epic. But what the &AElig;neid lacks of epic simplicity, it makes up
in patriotic spirit, in lofty moral and civic ideals, in correctness
of taste, and in stylistic form.</p>

<p><i>Ovid</i>, often alluded to in poetry by his other name, Naso, was
born in the year 43 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> He was educated for public life and held
some offices of considerable dignity; but poetry was his delight,
and he early resolved to cultivate it. He accordingly sought the
society of contemporary poets and was acquainted with Horace and
saw Virgil, though the latter died when Ovid was yet too young and
undistinguished to have formed his acquaintance. Ovid spent an
easy life at Rome in the enjoyment of a competent income. He
was intimate with the family of Augustus, the emperor; and it is
supposed that some serious offense given to a member of that family
was the cause of an event which reversed the poet's happy circumstances
and clouded the latter portion of his life. At the age of fifty
he was banished from Rome and ordered to betake himself to Tomi
on the borders of the Black Sea. His only consolation in exile was
to address his wife and absent friends. His letters were all in verse.
They are called the "Tristia," or Sorrows, and Letters from Pontus.
The two great works of Ovid are his "Metamorphoses" or Transformations,
and his "Fasti," or Poetic Calendar. They are both
mythological poems, and from the former we have taken many of
our stories of Grecian and Roman mythology. These poems have
thus been characterized:</p>

<p>"The rich mythology of Greece furnished Ovid, as it may still
furnish the poet, the painter, and the sculptor, with materials for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
his art. With exquisite taste, simplicity, and pathos he has narrated
the fabulous traditions of early ages, and given to them that
appearance of reality which only a master hand could impart.
His pictures of nature are striking and true; he selects with care
that which is appropriate; he rejects the superfluous, and when
he has completed his work, it is neither defective nor redundant.
The 'Metamorphoses' are read with pleasure by the young and
old of every civilized land."</p>

<p>In an incidental manner, <i>Horace</i>, the prince of Roman lyric
poets, and the lyric and elegiac writers, <i>Catullus</i>, <i>Tibullus</i>, and
<i>Propertius</i>, have liberally increased our knowledge of Greek and
Roman myth.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p><i>Seneca</i>, the teacher of Nero, is best known for his philosophical
treatises; but he wrote, also, tragedies, the materials of which are
well-known Greek legends. <i>Apuleius</i>, born in Africa, 114 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>,
interests us as the compiler of a clever romance, The Golden
Ass;<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> the most pleasing episode of which, the story of Cupid and
Psyche, has been elsewhere related.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>

<p><b>300. Records of Norse Mythology.</b><a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> A system of mythology
of especial interest,&mdash;as belonging to the race from which we,
through our English ancestors, derive our origin,&mdash;is that of the
Norsemen, who inhabited the countries now known as Sweden,
Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. Their mythological lore has
been transmitted by means of Runes, Skaldic poems, the Eddas,
and the Sagas.</p>

<p><i>The Runes.</i> The earliest method of writing prevalent among
the Norsemen was by runes. The word means <i>hidden lore</i>, or
<i>mystery</i>. The earliest runes were merely fanciful signs supposed
to possess mysterious power. As a synonym for <i>writing</i>, the term
was first applied to the Northern alphabet, itself derived from
ancient Greek and Roman coins. Of the old Scandinavian runes
several specimens have been found&mdash;one an inscription on a
golden horn of the third or fourth century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, which was dug
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>up in Schleswig a hundred and sixty years ago; another, on a
stone at Tune in Norway. From such an alphabet the Anglo-Saxon
runes were derived. Inscriptions in later Scandinavian runes
have been discovered in Sweden, Denmark, and the Isle of Man.
The characters are of the stiff and angular form necessitated by the
materials on which they were inscribed,&mdash;tombstones, spoons, chairs,
oars, and so forth.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> It is doubtful whether mythological poems were
ever written in this way; dedications to pagan deities, ditties of the
eleventh century, and love-spells have, however, been found.</p>

<p><i>The Skaldic Poems.</i> The bards and poets of the Norsemen
were the Skalds. They were the depositaries of whatever historic
lore there was; and it was their office to mingle something of
intellectual gratification with the rude feasts of the warriors, by rehearsing,
with such accompaniments of poetry and music as their
skill could afford, the exploits of heroes living or dead. Such songs
were called Drapas. The origin of Skaldic poetry is lost in mythic
or prehistoric darkness, but the Skalds of Iceland continued to play
a most important part in the literary development of the north as
late as the end of the fourteenth century. Without their co&ouml;peration,
the greater part of the songs and sagas of genuine antiquity
could hardly have reached us. The Skaldic diction, which was polished
to an artistic extreme, with its pagan metaphors and similes
retained its supremacy over literary form even after the influence of
Christianity had revolutionized national thought.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p><i>The Eddas.</i> The chief mythological records of the Norse are
the Eddas and the Sagas. The word <i>Edda</i> has usually been connected
with the Icelandic for <i>great-grandmother</i>;<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> it has also
been regarded as a corruption of the High German <i>Erda</i>, Mother
Earth, from whom, according to the lay in which the word first
occurs, the earliest race of mankind sprang,<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>&mdash;or as the <i>point</i>
or <i>head</i> of Norse poetry,<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> or as a tale concerned with <i>death</i>,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> or
as derived from Odde, the home of the reputed collector of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>Elder Edda. But, of recent years, scholars have looked with
most favor upon a derivation from the Icelandic <i>&oacute;&eth;r</i>, which means
mind, or poetry.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> There are two Icelandic collections called
Eddas: Snorri's and S&aelig;mund's. Until the year 1643 the name
was applied to a book, principally in prose, containing Mythical
Tales, a Treatise on the Poetic Art and Diction, a Poem on Meters,
and a Rhymed Glossary of Synonyms, with an appendix of minor
treatises on grammar and rhetoric&mdash;the whole intended as a guide
for poets. Although a note in the Upsala manuscript, of date
about 1300 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, asserted that this work was "put together" by
Snorri Sturlason, who lived 1178-1241, the world was not informed
of the fact until 1609, when Arngrim Johnsson made the
announcement in his Constitutional History of Iceland.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> While
the main treatises on the poetic art are, in general, Snorri's, the
treatises on grammar and rhetoric have been, with more or less
certitude, assigned to other writers of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. It is probable, too, that in the Mythical Tales, or the
Delusion of Gylfi, Snorri merely enlarged and edited with poetical
illustrations the work of earlier hands. The poets of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries do not speak of Snorri, but
they refer continually to the "rules of Edda," and frequently to
the obscurity and the conventionality of Eddic phraseology, figures,
and art. Even at the present day in Iceland it is common
to hear the term "void of Eddic art," or "a bungler in Eddic
art." A rearrangement of Snorri's Edda, by Magnus Olafsson
(1574-1636), is much better known than the original work.</p>

<p>In 1642, Bishop Bryniolf Sveinsson discovered a manuscript of
the mythological poems of Iceland. Misled by theories of his
own and by a fanciful suggestion of the famous antiquary Biorn
of Scardsa, he attributed the composition of these poems to S&aelig;mund
the Wise, a historian who lived 1056-1133. Henceforth,
consequently, Snorri's work is called the Younger, or Prose Edda,
in contradistinction to Bryniolf's find, which is known as the
Elder, the Poetical Edda, or the Edda of S&aelig;mund. The oldest
manuscript of the Poetical Edda is of the thirteenth century. Its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>contents were probably collected not later than 1150. The composition
of the poems cannot well be placed earlier than the ninth or
tenth centuries after Christ; and a consideration of the habits, laws,
geography, and vocabulary illustrated by the poems leads eminent
scholars to assign the authorship to emigrants of the south Norwegian
tribes who, sailing westward, "won Waterford and Limerick,
and kinged it in York and East England."<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> The poems are Icelandic,
however, in their general character and history. They are
principally of heroic and mythical import: such as the stories of
Balder's Fate, of Skirnir's Journey, of Thor's Hammer, of Helgi
the Hunding's Bane, and the twenty lays that in fragmentary fashion
tell the eventful history of the Volsungs and the Nibelungs.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p><i>The Sagas.</i> The Eddas contain many myths and mythical
features that contradict the national character of both Germans
and Norsemen, but the sagas have their roots in Norse civilization
and are national property.<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> Of these mythic-heroic prose
compositions the most important to us is the Volsunga Saga, which
was put together probably in the twelfth century and is based in
part upon the poems of the Elder Edda, in part upon floating
traditions, and in part upon popular songs that now are lost.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p><b>301. Records of German Mythology.</b>[**412] The story of the Volsungs
and the Nibelungs springs from mythological sources common
to the whole Teutonic race. Two distinct versions of the
saga survive,&mdash;the Low or North German, which we have already
noticed in the lays of the Elder Edda and in the Norse Volsunga
Saga, and the High or South German, which has been preserved
in German folk songs and in the Nibelungenlied, or Lay of the
Nibelungs, that has grown out of them. The Norse form of the
story exhibits a later survival of the credulous, or myth-making,
mental condition. The Lay of the Nibelungs absorbed, at an
earlier date, historical elements, and began sooner to restrict the
personality of its heroes within the compass of human limitations.<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span></p>

<p>Although there are many manuscripts, or fragments of manuscripts,
of the Nibelungenlied that attest its popularity between
the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was not until the Swiss
critic, J. J. Bodmer, published, in 1757, portions of two ancient
poems, "The Revenge of Kriemhild" and "The Lament over the
Heroes of Etzel," that the attention of modern scholars was called
to this famous German epic. Since that time many theories of the
composition of the Nibelungenlied have been advanced. It has
been held by some that the German epic is an adaptation of the
Norse version;<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> by others, that the Scandinavians, not the Germans,
borrowed the story; and by others still, that the epics, while
proceeding from a common cradle, are of independent growth.
The last theory is the most tenable.<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Concerning the history of
the Nibelungenlied, it has been maintained that since, during the
twelfth century, when no poet would adopt any other poet's
stanzaic form, the Austrian Von K&uuml;renberg used the stanzaic
form of the Nibelungenlied, the epic must be his.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> It has also
been urged that the poem, having been written down about 1140,
was altered in metrical form by younger poets, until, in 1200 or
thereabouts, it assumed the form preserved in the latest of the
three great manuscripts.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> But the theory advanced by Lachmann
is still of great value: that the poem consists of a number of
ancient ballads of various age and uneven worth; and that, about
1210, a collector, mending some of the ballads to suit himself,
strung them together on a thread of his own invention.</p>

<p>In fine, the materials of the poem would persuade us not only
of its origin in very ancient popular lays, but of their fusion and
improvement by the imaginative effort of at least one, and probably
of several poets, who lived and wrote between 1120 and
1200 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> The metrical structure, also, would indicate derivation
from the German folk song and modification due to multifarious
handling on the part of popular minstrels and poets of
written verse.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p><b>302. Records of Oriental Mythology: Egyptian.</b><a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> Although the
myths of Egypt, India, and Persia are of intense interest and importance,
they have not materially affected English literature. The
following is, however, a brief outline of the means by which some
of them have been preserved.</p>

<p>The Egyptian records are (1) <i>The Hieroglyphs</i>, or sacred inscriptions
in Tombs of the Kings, and other solemn places,&mdash;conveying
ideas by symbols, by phonetic signs, or by both; (2)
<i>The Sacred Papyri</i>, containing hymns to the gods; (3) <i>The</i>
<i>Books of the Dead</i> and of the <i>Lower Hemisphere</i>,&mdash;devoted to
necromantic incantations, prayers for the souls of the departed,
and other rituals.</p>

<p><b>303. Indian Records.</b> (1) <i>The Vedas</i>, or Holy Scriptures of the
Hindus, which fall into four divisions. The most ancient, the
Rig-Veda, consists of hymns of an elevated and spiritual character
composed by families of Rishis, or psalmists, as far back, perhaps,
as 3000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, not later than 1400 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> They give us the religious
conceptions of the Aryans when they crossed the Himalayas and
began to push toward Southern Hindustan. The Sama-Veda is
a book of solemn chants and tunes. The Yajur-Veda comprises
prayers for sacrificial occasions, and interpretations of the same.
The Atharva-Veda shows, as might be expected of the youngest
of the series, the influence upon the purer Aryan creed of superstitions
borrowed, perhaps, from the aboriginal tribes of India.
It contains spells for exorcising demons and placating them.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Indian Epics</i> of classical standing. They are the
Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata and the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana. Scholars differ as to the chronological
precedence. The Great Feud of the Bh&acirc;ratas has the
air of superior antiquity because of the numerous hands and
generations that have contributed to its composition. The Adventures
of R&acirc;ma, on the other hand, recalls a more primitive
stage of credulity and of savage invention. The Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata is
a storehouse of mythical tradition. It contains several well-rounded
epic poems, the most beautiful of which is the Episode
of Nala,&mdash;a prince who, succumbing to a weakness common to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>his contemporaries, has gambled away his kingdom. The Great
Feud of the Bh&acirc;ratas is, indeed, assigned to an author&mdash;but his
name, Vy&acirc;sa, means simply the Arranger. The R&acirc;m&acirc;yana purports
to have been written by the poet V&acirc;lm&icirc;ki. It tells how Sita,
the wife of Prince R&acirc;ma, is carried off to Ceylon by R&acirc;vana, king
of the demons, and how R&acirc;ma, by the aid of an army of monkeys,
bridges the straits between India and Ceylon and, slaying the
demon, recovers his lovely and innocent wife. The resemblance
between the plot and that of the Iliad has inclined some scholars
to derive the Indian from the Greek epic. But, until the relative
antiquity of the poems is established, the Iliad might as well
be derived from the R&acirc;m&acirc;yana. The theory is unsubstantiated.
These epics of India lack the artistic spirit and grace of the Iliad
and the Odyssey, but they display a keener sympathy with nature
and a more romantic appreciation of the loves and sorrows of
mankind.</p>

<p><b>304. Persian Records.</b> <i>The Avesta</i>, or Sacred Book of the
ancient Persians, composed in the Zend language and later translated
into medieval Persian,&mdash;or Pahlavi,&mdash;contains the G&aacute;th&aacute;s,
or hymns of Zoroaster and his contemporaries, and scriptures of
as recent a date as the fifth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Zoroaster, a holy man
of God, was the founder or the reformer of the Persian religion.
He lived as early as the fourteenth or fifteenth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and
his system became the dominant religion of Western Asia from
the time of Cyrus (550 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) to the conquest of Persia by Alexander
the Great. The teachings of Zoroaster are characterized by
beautiful simplicity, and by an unwavering faith in the ultimate
victory of righteousness (Ormuzd) over evil (Ahriman).</p>

<p><b>3. Chaos</b>: a gap. Compare the "Beginning Gap" of Norse mythology. <b>Eros</b>:
a yearning. <b>Erebus</b>: black, from root meaning <i>to cover</i>.</p>

<p><b>4. Uranus</b> (Greek <i>Ouranos</i>) corresponds with the name of the Indian divinity
Varunas, root <i>var</i>, 'to cover.' Uranus is the starry vault that covers the earth;
Varunas became the rain-giving sky. <b>Titan</b>: the honorable, powerful; the king;
later, the signification was limited to the sun. <b>Oceanus</b> probably means <i>flood</i>.
<b>Tethys</b>: the nourisher, nurse. <b>Hyperion</b>: the wanderer on high;<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> the sun. <b>Thea</b>:
the beautiful, shining; the moon. She is called by Homer Eurypha&euml;ssa, the far-shining.
<b>Iapetus</b>: the sender, hurler, wounder. <b>Themis</b>: that which is established,
law. <b>Mnemosyne</b>: memory. Other Titans were C&oelig;us and Ph&oelig;be, figurative
of the radiant lights of heaven; Cre&uuml;s and Eurybi&euml;, mighty powers, probably of
the sea; Ophion, the great serpent, and Eurynome, the far-ruling, who, according
to Apollonius of Rhodes, held sway over the Titans until Cronus cast them
into the Ocean, or into Tartarus.</p>

<p><b>Cronus</b> (Greek <i>Kronos</i>) is, as his name shows, the god of ripening, harvest,
maturity. <b>Rhea</b> comes from Asia Minor, and was there worshiped as the Mother
Earth, dwelling creative among the mountains. Cronus (<i>Kronos</i>) has been naturally,
but wrongly, identified with Chronos, the personification of <i>Time</i>, which, as
it brings all things to an end, devours its own offspring; and also with the Latin
Saturn, who, as a god of agriculture and harvest, was represented with pruning-knife
in hand, and regarded as the lord of an ancient golden age.</p>

<p>The three <b>Cyclopes</b> were Brontes, Steropes, and Arges. Cyclops means the
round-eyed. The <b>Hecatonchires</b> were Briareus, the strong, called also &AElig;g&aelig;on;
Cottus, the striker; Gyes, or Gyges, the vaulter, or crippler. Gyges is called by
Horace (Carm. 2, 17, 14) Centimanus,&mdash;the hundred-handed.</p>

<p><b><i>Illustrative.</i></b> Milton, in Paradise Lost, 10, 581, refers to the tradition of Ophion
and Eurynome, who "had first the rule of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driven."
<b>Hyperion</b>: see Shakespeare's Hamlet, "Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove

<p><b>5.</b> Homer makes Zeus (Jupiter) the oldest of the sons of Cronus; Hesiod makes
him the youngest, in accordance with a widespread savage custom which makes the
youngest child heir in chief.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lang</span>, Myth, Ritual, etc., 1, 297. According to
other legends Zeus was born in Arcadia, or even in Epirus at Dodona, where was
his sacred grove. He was in either case reared by the nymphs of the locality.
According to Hesiod, Theog. 730, he was born in a cave of Mount Dicte, in Crete.</p>

<p><b>6. Atlas</b>, according to other accounts, was not doomed to support the heavens
until after his encounter with Perseus.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> See Milton's Hymn on the Nativity, "Not <b>Typhon</b> huge ending in snaky
twine." The monster is also called Typhoeus (Hesiod, Theog. 1137). The name
means <i>to smoke</i>, <i>to burn</i>. The monster personifies fiery vapors proceeding from
subterranean places. Other famous <b>Giants</b> were Mimas, Polybotes, Ephialtes,
Rh&oelig;tus, Clytius. See Preller, 1, 60. Briareus (really a Centimanus) is frequently
ranked among the giants.</p>

642, 688; Samson Agonistes, 148.</p>

<p><b>10-15. Prometheus</b>: forethought.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> <b>Epimetheus</b>: afterthought. According to
&AElig;schylus (Prometheus Bound) the doom of Zeus (Jupiter) was only contingent. If
he should refuse to set Prometheus free and should, therefore, ignorant of the secret,
wed Thetis, of whom it was known to Prometheus that her son should be greater
than his father, then Zeus would be dethroned. If, however, Zeus himself delivered
Prometheus, that Titan would reveal his secret and Zeus would escape both the marriage
and its fateful result. The Prometheus Unbound of &AElig;schylus is lost; but its
name indicates that in the sequel the Titan is freed from his chains. And from hints
in the Prometheus Bound we gather that this liberation was to come about in the way
mentioned above, Prometheus warning Zeus to marry Thetis to Peleus (whose son,
Achilles, proved greater than his father,&mdash;see <b>191</b>); or by the intervention of Hercules
who was to be descended in the thirteenth generation from Zeus and Io (see
<b>161</b> and <b>C. 149</b>); or by the voluntary sacrifice of the Centaur Chiron, who, when Zeus
should hurl Prometheus and his rock into Hades, was destined to substitute himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>for the Titan, and so by vicarious atonement to restore him to the life of the upper
world. In Shelley's great drama of Prometheus Unbound, the Zeus of tyranny
and ignorance and superstition is overthrown by Reason, the gift of Prometheus
to mankind. <b>Sicyon</b> (or Mecone): a city of the Peloponnesus, near Corinth.</p>

<p><b>16. Dante</b> (<i>Durante</i>) <b>degli Alighieri</b> was born in Florence, 1265. Banished by
his political opponents, 1302, he remained in exile until his death, which took
place in Ravenna, 1321. His Vita Nuova (New Life), recounting his ideal love
for Beatrice Portinari, was written between 1290 and 1300; his great poem, the
Divina Commedia (the Divine Comedy) consisting of three parts,&mdash;Inferno,
Purgatorio, Paradiso,&mdash;during the years of his exile. Of the Divine Comedy,
says Lowell, "It is the real history of a brother man, of a tempted, purified, and
at last triumphant human soul." <b>John Milton</b> (b. 1608) was carried by the stress
of the civil war, 1641-1649, away from poetry, music, and the art which he had
sedulously cultivated, into the stormy sea of politics and war. Perhaps the severity
of his later sonnets and the sublimity of his Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained,
and Samson Agonistes are the fruit of the stern years of controversy through
which he lived, not as a poet, but as a statesman and a pamphleteer. <b>Cervantes</b>
(1547-1616), the author of the greatest of Spanish romances, Don Quixote. His
life was full of adventure, privation, suffering, with but brief seasons of happiness
and renown. He distinguished himself at the battle of Lepanto, 1571; but in 1575,
being captured by Algerine cruisers, he remained five years in harsh captivity.
After his return to Spain he was neglected by those in power. For full twenty
years he struggled for his daily bread. Don Quixote was published in and after
1605. <b>Corybantes</b>: the priests of Cybele, whose festivals were violent, and whose
worship consisted of dances and noise suggestive of battle.</p>

<p><b>18. Astr&aelig;a</b> was placed among the stars as the constellation Virgo, the virgin.
Her mother was Themis (Justice). Astr&aelig;a holds aloft a pair of scales, in which
she weighs the conflicting claims of parties. The old poets prophesied a return
of these goddesses and of the Golden Age. See also Pope's Messiah,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All crimes shall cease, and ancient fraud shall fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning Justice lift aloft her scale:<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>
<p>and Milton's Hymn on the Nativity, 14, 15. In Paradise Lost, 4, 998 <i>et seq.</i>, is a
different conception of the golden scales, "betwixt Astr&aelig;a and the Scorpion sign."
Emerson moralizes the myth in his Astr&aelig;a.</p>

<p><b>19-20. <i>Illustrative.</i></b> B. W. Procter, The Flood of Thessaly. See Ovid's famous
narrative of the Four Ages and the Flood, Metamorphoses, 1, 89-415. <b>Deucalion</b>:
Bayard Taylor, Prince Deukalion; Milton, Paradise Lost, 11, 12.</p>

<p><i><b>Interpretative.</b></i> This myth combines two stories of the origin of the Hellenes,
or indigenous Greeks,&mdash;one, in accordance with which the Hellenes, as earthborn,
claimed descent from Pyrrha (the red earth); the other and older, by which
Deucalion was represented as the only survivor of the flood, but still the founder
of the race (Greek la&oacute;s), which he created by casting stones (Greek l&acirc;es) behind
him. The myth, therefore, proceeds from an unintended pun. Although,
finally, Pyrrha was by myth-makers made the wife of Deucalion, the older myth
of the origin of the race from stones was preserved. See Max M&uuml;ller, Sci. Relig.,
London, 1873, p. 64.</p>

Phoroneus. For the descendants of Deucalion and Hellen, see Table I of this

Forest, 33, 234; E. C. Stedman, News from Olympia. See also E. W. Gosse,
Greece and England (On Viol and Flute).</p>

<p><b>23. The Olympian Gods.</b> There were, according to Mr. Gladstone (<i>No. Am.</i>
<i>Rev.</i> April, 1892), about twenty Olympian deities:<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> (1) The five really great
gods, Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Apollo, and Athene; (2) Heph&aelig;stus, Ares, Hermes,
Iris, Leto, Artemis, Themis, Aphrodite, Dione, P&aelig;&euml;on (or P&aelig;on), and Hebe,&mdash;also
usually present among the assembled immortals; (3) Demeter, Persephone,
Dionysus, and Thetis, whose claims are more or less obscured. According to the
same authority, the <b>Distinctive Qualities of the Homeric Gods</b> were as follows:
(1) they were immortal; (2) they were incorporated in human form; (3) they
enjoyed power far exceeding that possessed by mortals; (4) they were, however
(with the possible exception of Athene, who is never ignorant, never deceived,
never baffled), all liable to certain limitations of energy and knowledge; (5) they
were subject also to corporeal wants and to human affections. The <b>Olympian</b>
<b>Religion</b>, as a whole, was more careful of nations, states, public affairs, than of individuals
and individual character; and in this respect, according to Mr. Gladstone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>it differs from Christianity. He holds, however,
that despite the occasional immoralities of the
gods, their general government not only "makes
for righteousness," but is addressed to the end of
rendering it triumphant. Says Zeus, for instance,
in the Olympian assembly, "Men complain of us
the gods, and say that we are the source from
whence ills proceed; but they likewise themselves
suffer woes outside the course of destiny, through
their own perverse offending." But, beside this
general effort for the triumph of right, there is little
to be said in abatement of the general proposition
that, whatever be their collective conduct, the common
speech of the gods is below the human level
in point of morality.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p><b>24-25. Zeus.</b> In Sanskrit <i>Dyaus</i>, in Latin
<i>Jovis</i>, in German <i>Tiu</i>. The same name for the
Almighty (the Light or Sky) used probably thousands
of years before Homer, or the Sanskrit Bible
(the Vedas). It is not merely the blue sky, nor the
sky personified,&mdash;not merely worship of a natural
phenomenon, but of the Father who is in Heaven.
So in the Vedas we find <i>Dyaus pitar</i>, in the Greek <i>Zeu</i>
<i>pater</i>, in Latin <i>Jupiter</i> all meaning <i>father of light</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Max</span>

<p><b>26. Juno</b> was called by the Romans Juno Lucina, the special goddess of childbirth.
In her honor wives held the festival of the Matronalia on the first of March
of each year. The Latin <b>Juno</b> is for <i>Diou-n-on</i>, from the stem <i>Diove</i>, and is the
feminine parallel of Jovis, just as the Greek Dione (one of the loves of Zeus) is
the feminine of Zeus. These names (and Diana, too) come from the root <i>div</i>, 'to
shine,' 'to illumine.' There are many points of resemblance between the Italian
Juno and the Greek Dione (identified with Hera, as Hera-Dione). Both are goddesses
of the moon (?), of women, of marriage; to both the cow (with moon-crescent
horns) is sacred. See Roscher, 21, 576-579. But Overbeck insists
that the loves of Zeus are deities of the earth: "The rains of heaven (Zeus) do
not fall upon the moon."</p>

<p><i><b>Illustrative.</b></i> W. S. Landor, Hymn of Terpander to Juno; Lewis Morris, Her&eacute;,
in The Epic of Hades.</p>

<p><b><i>In Art.</i></b> Of the statues of Juno the most celebrated was that made by Polyclitus
for her temple between Argos and Mycen&aelig;. It was of gold and ivory. See Paus.
2, 17, 4. The goddess was seated on a throne of magnificent proportions; she
wore a crown upon which were figured the Graces and the Hours; in one hand
she held a pomegranate, in the other a scepter surmounted by a cuckoo. Of the
extant representations of Juno the most famous are the Argive Hera (Fig. 9
in the text), the torso in Vienna from Ephesus, the Hera of the Vatican at Rome,
the bronze statuette in the Cabinet of Coins and Antiquities in Vienna, the
Farnese bust in the National Museum in Naples, the Ludovisi bust in the villa
of that name in Rome, the Pompeian wall painting of the marriage of Zeus and
Hera (given by Baumeister, Denkm&auml;ler 1, 649; see also Roscher, 13, 2127),
and the Juno of Lanuvium.</p>

<p><b>27. Athen&euml;</b> (Athena) has some characteristics of the warlike kind in common
with the Norse Valkyries, but she is altogether a more ideal conception. The best
description of the goddess will be found in Homer's Iliad, 5, 730 <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>The derivation of <b>Athene</b> is uncertain (Preller). Related, say some, to <i>&aelig;th&#x0113;r</i>,
&#945;&#7984;&#952;&#8053;&#961;, the clear upper air; say others, to the word <i>anthos</i>, &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#959;&#962;, 'a flower'&mdash;virgin
bloom; or (see Roscher, p. 684) to <i>ath&#x0113;r</i>, &#7936;&#952;&#8053;&#961;, 'spear point.' Max M&uuml;ller derives
Athene from the root <i>ah</i>, which yields the Sanskrit Ahan&acirc; and the Greek Daphne,
the Dawn (?). Hence Athene is the Dawn-goddess; but she is also the goddess
of wisdom, because "the goddess who caused people to wake was involuntarily
conceived as the goddess who caused people to know" (Science of Language,
1, 548-551). This is poor philology.</p>

<p>Epithets applied to Athene are the bright-eyed, the gray-eyed, the &aelig;gis-bearing,
the unwearied daughter of Zeus.</p>

<p>The festival of the <b>Panathen&aelig;a</b> was celebrated at Athens yearly in commemoration
of the union of the Attic tribes. See <b>C. 176-181</b>.</p>

<p>The name <b>Pallas</b> characterizes the goddess as the <i>brandisher</i> of lightnings. Her
Palladium&mdash;or sacred image&mdash;holds always high in air the brandished lance.</p>

<p><b>Minerva</b>, or <b>Menerva</b>, is connected with Latin <i>mens</i>, Greek <i>m&eacute;nos</i>, Sanskrit
<i>manas</i>, 'mind'; not with the Latin <i>mane</i>, 'morning.' The relation is not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
plausible between the awakening of the day and the awakening of thought (Max
M&uuml;ller, Sci. Lang, 1, 552).</p>

<p><i><b>In Art.</b></i> The finest of the statues of this goddess was by Phidias, in the Parthenon,
or temple of Athena, at Athens. The Athena of the Parthenon has
disappeared; but there is good ground to believe that we have, in several extant
statues and busts, the artist's conception. (See Frontispiece, the Lemnian Athena,
and Fig. 53, the Hope Athena, ancient marble at Deepdene, Surrey.) The
figure is characterized by grave and dignified beauty, and freedom from any
transient expression; in other words, by repose. The most important copy
extant is of the Roman period. The goddess was represented standing; in one
hand a spear, in the other a statue of Victory. Her helmet, highly decorated, was
surmounted by a Sphinx. The statue was forty feet in height, and, like the Jupiter,
covered with ivory and gold. The eyes were of marble, and probably painted to
represent the iris and pupil. The Parthenon, in which this statue stood, was also
constructed under the direction and superintendence of Phidias. Its exterior was
enriched with sculptures, many of them from the hand of the same artist. The
Elgin Marbles now in the British Museum are a part of them. Also remarkable
are the Minerva Bellica (Capitol, Rome); the Athena of the Acropolis Museum;
the Athena of the &AElig;gina Marbles (Glyptothek, Munich); the Minerva Medica
(Vatican); the Athena of Velletri in the Louvre. (See Fig. 10.) In modern
sculpture, especially excellent are Thorwaldsen's Minerva and Prometheus, and
Cellini's Minerva (on the base of his Perseus). In modern painting, Tintoretto's
Minerva defeating Mars.</p>

<p><b>28.</b> While the Latin god <b>Mars</b> corresponds with Ares, he has also not a few
points of similarity with the Greek Ph&oelig;bus; for both names, Mars and Ph&oelig;bus,
indicate the quality <i>shining</i>. In Rome, the Campus Martius (field of Mars) was
sacred to this deity. Here military maneuvers and athletic contests took place;
here Mars was adored by sacrifice, and here stood his temple, where his priests,
the Salii, watched over the sacred spear and the shield, <i>Ancile</i>, that fell from
heaven in the reign of Numa Pompilius. Generals supplicated Mars for victory,
and dedicated to him the spoils of war. See Roscher, pp. 478, 486, on the fundamental
significance, philosophical and physical, of <i>Ares</i>. On the derivation of
the Latin name <i>Mars</i>, see Roscher (end of article on Apollo).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span></p>

<p><i><b>Illustrative in Art.</b></i> Of archaic figures, that upon the so-called Fran&ccedil;ois Vase in
Florence represents <b>Ares</b> bearded and with the armor of a Homeric warrior.
In the art of the second half of the fifth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, he is represented as beardless,
standing with spear and helmet and, generally, <i>chlamys</i> (short warrior's cloak);
so the marble Ares statue (called the Borghese Achilles) in the Louvre. There
is a later type (preferred in Rome) of the god in Corinthian helmet pushed back
from the forehead, the right hand leaning on a spear, in the left a sword with
point upturned, over the left arm a <i>chlamys</i>. The finest representation of the
deity extant is the <i>Ares Ludovisi</i> in Rome, probably of the second half of the
fourth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>,&mdash;a sitting figure, beautiful in form and feature, with an Eros
playing at his feet. (See Fig. 11.) Modern sculpture: Thorwaldsen's relief,
Mars and Cupid. Modern painting, Raphael's Mars (text, Fig. 12).</p>

<p><b>29.</b> On the derivation of <b>Heph&aelig;stus</b>, see Roscher, p. 2037. From Greek <i>aph&#x0113;</i>,
'to kindle,' or <i>pha</i>, 'to shine,' or <i>spha</i>, 'to burn.' The Latin <b>Vulcan</b>, while a god of
fire, is not represented by the Romans as possessed of technical skill. It is said that
Romulus built him a temple in Rome and instituted the Vulcanalia,&mdash;a festival in
honor of the god. The name <i>Vulcanus</i>, or <i>Volcanus</i>, is popularly connected with
the Latin <i>fulgere</i>, 'to flash' or 'lighten,' <i>fulgur</i> a 'flash of lightning,' etc. It is quite
natural that, in many legends, fire should play an active part in the creation of man.
The primitive belief of the Indo-Germanic race was that the fire-god, descending
to earth, became the first man; and that, therefore, the spirit of man was composed
of fire. Vulcan is also called by the Romans Mulciber, from <i>mulceo</i>, 'to soften.'</p>

</div></div>

<p><i><b>In Art.</b></i> Various antique illustrations are extant of the god as a smith with
hammer, or at the forge (text, Fig. 13); one of him working with the Cyclopes;
a vase painting of him adorning Pandora; one of him assisting at the birth of
Minerva; and one of his return to Olympus led by Bacchus and Comus. Of
modern paintings the following are noteworthy: J. A. Wiertz, Forge of Vulcan;
Velasquez, Forge of Vulcan (Museum, Madrid) (text, Fig. 56); the Forge of
Vulcan by Tintoretto. Thorwaldsen's piece of statuary, Vulcan forging Arrows for
Cupid, is justly famous.</p>

<p><b>30. Castalia</b>: on the slopes of Parnassus, sacred to Apollo and the Muses.
<b>Cephissus</b>: in Phocis and B&oelig;otia. (Another Cephissus flows near Athens.)</p>

<p><i><b>Interpretative.</b></i> The birth, wanderings, return of <b>Apollo</b>, and his struggle with
the Python, etc., are explained by many scholars as symbolic of the annual course
of the sun. Apollo is born of Leto, who is, according to hypothesis, the Night
from which the morning sun issues. His conflict with the dragon reminds one of
Siegfried's combat and that of St. George, The <b>dragon</b> is variously interpreted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
as symbolical of darkness, mephitic vapors, or the forces of winter, which are
overcome by the rays of the springtide sun. The dragon is called Delphyne, or
Python. The latter name may be derived simply from that part of Phocis (Pytho)
where the town of Delphi was situate, or that again from the Greek root <i>p&#x016B;th</i>, 'to
rot,' because there the serpent was left by Apollo to decay; or from the Greek
<i>p&#x016D;th</i>, 'to inquire,' with reference to the consultation of the Delphian or Pythian
oracle. "It is open to students to regard the <b>dolphin</b> as only one of the many
animals whose earlier worship is concentrated in Apollo, or to take the creature
for the symbol of spring when seafaring becomes easier to mortals, or to interpret
the dolphin as the result of a <i>volks-etymologie</i> (popular derivation), in which the
name <i>Delphi</i> (meaning originally a hollow in the hills) was connected with <i>delphis</i>,
the dolphin."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lang</span>, Myth, Ritual, etc., 2, 197. Apollo is also called <b>Lycius</b>, which
means, not the wolf-slayer, as is sometimes stated, for the wolf is sacred to Apollo,
but either the wolf-god (as inheriting an earlier wolf-cult) or the golden god of
Light. See Preller and Roscher. This derivation is more probable than that
from <i>Lycia</i> in Asia Minor, where the god was said originally to have been worshiped.
To explain certain rational myths of Apollo as referring to the annual
and diurnal journeys of the sun is justifiable. To explain the savage and senseless
survivals of the Apollo-myth in that way is impossible.</p>

<p><b>Festivals.</b> The most important were as follows: (1) The <b>Delphinia</b>, in May,
to celebrate the genial influence of the young sun upon the waters, in opening
navigation, in restoring warmth and life to the creatures of the wave, especially
to the dolphins, which were highly esteemed by the superstitious seafarers, fishermen,
merchants, etc. (2) The <b>Thargelia</b>, in the Greek month of that name, our May,
which heralded the approach of the hot season. The purpose of this festival was
twofold: to propitiate the deity of the sun and forfend the sickness of summer;
to celebrate the ripening of vegetation and return thanks for first-fruits. These
festivals were held in Athens, Delos, and elsewhere. (3) The <b>Hyacinthian</b> fast
and feast of Sparta, corresponding in both features to the Thargelian. It was held
in July, in the oppressive days of the Dog Star, Sirius. (4) The <b>Carnean</b> of Sparta,
celebrated in August. It added to the propitiatory features of the Hyacinthian, a
thanksgiving for the vintage. (5) Another vintage-festival was the <b>Pyanepsian</b>,
in Athens. (6) The <b>Daphnephoria</b>: "Familiar to many English people from Sir
Frederick Leighton's picture. This feast is believed to have symbolized the
year.... An olive branch supported a central ball of brass, beneath which was
a smaller ball, and thence little globes were hung." "The greater ball means the
sun, the smaller the moon, the tiny globes the stars, and the three hundred and
sixty-five laurel garlands used in the feast are understood to symbolize the days."
(<i>Proclus and Pausanias.</i>)&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lang</span>, Myth, Ritual, etc., 2. 194, 195. Apollo is also
called the <b>Sminthian</b>, or Mouse-god, because he was regarded either as the protector
or as the destroyer of mice. In the Troad mice were fed in his temple;
elsewhere he was honored as freeing the country from them. As Mr. Lang says
(Myth, Ritual, etc., 2, 201), this is intelligible "if the vermin which had once
been sacred became a pest in the eyes of later generations."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Oracle of Delphi.</b> It had been observed at a very early period that the goats
feeding on Parnassus were thrown into convulsions when they approached a
certain long deep cleft in the side of the mountain. This was owing to a peculiar
vapor arising out of the cavern, and a certain goatherd is said to have tried its
effects upon himself. Inhaling the intoxicating air, he was affected in the same
manner as the cattle had been; and the inhabitants of the surrounding country,
unable to explain the circumstance, imputed the convulsive ravings to which he
gave utterance while under the power of the exhalations to a divine inspiration.
The fact was speedily spread abroad, and a temple was erected on the spot. The
prophetic influence was at first variously attributed to the goddess Earth, to Neptune,
Themis, and others, but it was at length assigned to Apollo, and to him alone.
A priestess was appointed whose office it was to inhale the hallowed air, and she
was named the Pythia. She was prepared for this duty by previous ablution at
the fountain of Castalia, and being crowned with laurel was seated upon a tripod
similarly adorned, which was placed over the chasm whence the divine afflatus
proceeded. Her inspired words while thus situated were interpreted by the priests.</p>

<p>Other famous oracles were that of <b>Trophonius</b> in B&oelig;otia and that of the
Egyptian <b>Apis</b>. Since those who descended into the cave at Lebadea to consult
the oracle of Trophonius were noticed to return dejected and melancholy, the
proverb arose which was applied to a low-spirited person, "He has been consulting
the oracle of Trophonius."</p>

<p>At Memphis the sacred bull Apis gave answer to those who consulted him, by
the manner in which he received or rejected what was presented to him. If the
bull refused food from the hand of the inquirer, it was considered an unfavorable
sign, and the contrary when he received it.</p>

<p>It used to be questioned whether oracular responses ought to be ascribed to
mere human contrivance or to the agency of evil spirits. The latter opinion
would of course obtain during ages of superstition, when evil spirits were credited
with an influence over human affairs. A third theory has been advanced since
the phenomena of mesmerism have attracted attention: that something like the
mesmeric trance was induced in the Pythoness, and the faculty of clairvoyance
called into action.</p>

<p>Scholars have also sought to determine when the pagan oracles ceased to give
responses. Ancient Christian writers assert that they became silent at the birth
of Christ, and were heard no more after that date; Milton adopts this view in his
Hymn on the Nativity, and in lines of solemn and elevated beauty pictures the
consternation of the heathen idols at the advent of the Saviour:</p>

<p><i><b>In Art.</b></i> One of the most esteemed of all the remains of ancient sculpture is
the statue of Apollo, called the Belvedere from the name of the apartment of the
Pope's palace at Rome in which it is placed (see Fig. 15). The artist is unknown.
It is conceded to be a work of Roman art, of about the first century of our era
(and follows a type fashioned by a Greek sculptor of the Hellenistic period, probably
in bronze). A variation of the type has been discovered in a bronze statuette
which represents Apollo holding in the left hand an &aelig;gis. Some scholars have
therefore surmised that the Apollo of the original was similarly equipped. The
Belvedere Apollo, however, is a standing figure, in marble, more than seven feet
high, naked except for the cloak which is fastened around the neck and hangs over
the extended left arm. It is restored to represent the god in the moment when he
has shot the arrow to destroy the monster Python. The victorious divinity is in
the act of stepping forward. The left arm which seems to have held the bow is
outstretched, and the head is turned in the same direction. In attitude and proportion
the graceful majesty of the figure is unsurpassed. The effect is completed
by the countenance, where, on the perfection of youthful godlike beauty, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
dwells the consciousness of triumphant power. To this statue Byron alludes in
Childe Harold, 4, 161:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Or view the Lord of the unerring bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The God of life, and poetry, and light,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Sun, in human limbs arrayed, and brow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All radiant from his triumph in the fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The shaft hath just been shot&mdash;the arrow bright<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With an immortal's vengeance; in his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And nostril, beautiful disdain, and might<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And majesty flash their full lightnings by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Developing in that one glance the Deity.<br /></span>
</div></div>

sculpture are the "Adonis" Apollo of the Vatican (Fig. 14, text); the Greek
bronze from Thessaly (Fig. 16, text); the Palatine Apollo in the Vatican (Fig.
66, text); the Apollo Cithar&oelig;dus of the National Museum, Naples, and the
Glyptothek, Munich; the Lycian Apollo; the Apollo Nomios; Apollo of Thera;
the Apollo of Michelangelo (National Museum, Florence). A painting of
romantic interest is Paolo Veronese's St. Christina refusing to adore Apollo.
Of symbolic import is the Apollo (Sunday) by Raphael in the Vatican. Ph&oelig;bus
and Boreas by J. F. Millet.</p>

<p><b>32. Latona.</b> A theory of the numerous <b>love-affairs</b> of Jupiter is given in <b>24</b>
of the text. <b>Delos</b> is the central island of the Cyclades group in the &AElig;gean.
With its temple of Apollo it was exceedingly prosperous.</p>

<p><i><b>Interpretative.</b></i> Latona (Leto), according to ancient interpreters, was night,&mdash;the
shadow, therefore, of Juno (Hera), if Hera be the splendor of heaven. But
the early myth-makers would hardly have reasoned so abstrusely. It is not at all
certain that the name <i>Leto</i> means darkness (Preller 1, 190, note 4); and even if
light is born of or after darkness, the sun (Apollo) and the moon (Artemis, or
Diana) can hardly be considered to be twins of Darkness (Leto), for they do not
illuminate the heavens at the same time.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lang</span>, Myth, Ritual, etc., 2, 199.</p>

<p><i><b>Illustrative.</b></i> Byron's allusion to Delos in Don Juan, 3, 86:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The isles of Greece! the isles of Greece!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where burning Sappho loved and sung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where grew the arts of war and peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where Delos rose, and Ph&oelig;bus sprung!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eternal summer gilds them yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all, except their sun, is set.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>See Milton's Sonnet, "I did but prompt the age to quit their clogs," for allusion
to Latona.</p>

<p><i><b>In Art.</b></i> In the shrine of Latona in Delos there was, in the days of Athen&aelig;us,
a shapeless wooden idol.</p>

<p><b>Diana.</b> The Latin <b>Diana</b> means either "goddess of the bright heaven," or
"goddess of the bright day." She is frequently identified with Artemis, Hecate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>Luna, and Selene. According to one tradition, Apollo and Diana were born at
<b>Ortygia</b>, near Ephesus. <b>Diana of the Ephesians</b>, referred to (Acts xix, 28), was a
goddess of not at all the maidenly characteristics that belonged to the Greek
Artemis (Roscher, p. 591; A. Lang, 2, 217). Other titles of Artemis are Munychia,
the moon-goddess; Calliste, the <i>fair</i>, or the <i>she-bear</i>; Orthia, the <i>severe</i>,
worshiped among the Taurians with human sacrifices; Agrotera, the <i>huntress</i>;
Pythia; Eileithyia, goddess of childbirth; Cynthia, born on Mount Cynthus.</p>

of Venice, V, i, "Come, ho, and wake Diana with a hymn," etc.; Twelfth Night,
I, iv; Midsummer Night's Dream, I, iv; All's Well that Ends Well, I, iii; IV, ii;
IV, iv; Butler, Hudibras, 3, 2, 1448. <i><b>Poems</b></i>: B. W. Procter, The Worship of Dian;
W. W. Story, Artemis; E. W. Gosse, The Praise of Artemis; E. Arnold, Hymn
of the Priestess of Diana; Wordsworth, To Lycoris; Lewis Morris, Artemis, in
The Epic of Hades; A. Lang, To Artemis. <b>Ph&oelig;be</b> (Diana): Spenser, Epithalamion;
Keats, To Psyche. <b>Cynthia</b> (Diana): Spenser, Prothalamion, Epithalamion;
Milton, Hymn on the Nativity; H. K. White, Ode to Contemplation.</p>

<p><i><b>In Art.</b></i> In art the goddess is represented high-girt for the chase, either in the
act of drawing an arrow from her quiver or watching her missile in its flight. She
is often attended by the hind. Sometimes, as moon-goddess, she bears a torch.
Occasionally she is clad in a <i>chiton</i>, or robe of many folds, flowing to her feet.
The Diana of the Hind (<i>&agrave; la Biche</i>), in the Palace of the Louvre (see Fig. 18),
may be considered the counterpart of the Apollo Belvedere. The attitude much
resembles that of Apollo, the sizes correspond and also the styles of execution.
The Diana of the Hind is a work of a high order, though by no means equal to
the Apollo. The attitude is that of hurried and eager motion, the face that of a
huntress in the excitement of the chase. The left hand of the goddess is extended
over the forehead of the hind which runs by her side, the right arm reaches
backward over the shoulder to draw an arrow from the quiver. Fig. 19 in the
text is the Artemis Knagia (Diana Cnagia), named after Cnageus, a servant of
Diana who assisted in transferring the statue from Crete to Sparta. In Dresden
there is a statue of Artemis in the style of Praxiteles (Fig. 68, text); and in the
Louvre an ancient marble called the Artemis of Gabii (Fig. 77, text).</p>

<p>In modern painting, noteworthy are the Diana and her Nymphs of Rubens;
Correggio's Diana (Fig. 17); Jules Lefebvre's Diana and her Nymphs; Domenichino's
Diana's Chase. Note also the allegorical Luna (Monday) of Raphael in
the Vatican; and D. G. Rossetti's Diana, in crayons.</p>

<p><b>34. <i>Interpretative.</i></b> The worship of <b>Aphrodite</b> was probably of Semitic origin,
but was early introduced into Greece. The Aphrodite of Hesiod and Homer displays
both Oriental and Grecian characteristics. All Semitic nations, except the
Hebrews, worshiped a supreme goddess who presided over the moon (or the
Star of Love), and over all animal and vegetable life and growth. She was
the Istar of the Assyrians, the Astarte of the Ph&oelig;nicians, and is the analogue of
the Greek Aphrodite and the Latin Venus. See Roscher, p. 390, etc. The native
Greek deity of love would appear to have been, however, <b>Dione</b>, goddess of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
moist and productive soil (<b>C. 26</b>), who passes in the Iliad (5. 370, 428) as the
mother of Aphrodite, is worshiped at Dodona by the side of Zeus, and is
regarded by Euripides as <i>Thyone</i>, mother of Dionysus (Preller I, 259).</p>

<p>The epithets and names most frequently applied to Aphrodite are the Paphian,
Cypris (the Cyprus-born), Cytherea, Erycina (from Mount Eryx), Pandemos
(goddess of vulgar love), Pelagia (Aphrodite of the sea), Urania (Aphrodite of
ideal love), Anadyomene (rising from the water); she is, also, the sweetly smiling,
laughter-loving, bright, golden, fruitful, winsome, flower-faced, blushing,
swift-eyed, golden-crowned.</p>

<p>She had temples and groves in Paphos, Abydos, Samos, Ephesus, Cyprus,
Cythera, in some of which&mdash;for instance, Paphos&mdash;gorgeous annual festivals
were held. See Childe Harold, I, 66.</p>

<p><b>Venus</b> was a deity of extreme antiquity among the Romans, but not of great
importance until she had acquired certain attributes of the Eastern Aphrodite.
She was worshiped as goddess of love, as presiding over marriage, as the goddess
who turns the hearts of men, and, later, even as a goddess of victory. A
festival in her honor, called the Veneralia, was held in Rome in April.</p>

<p><b><i>Illustrative.</i></b> See Chaucer's Knight's Tale for frequent references to the goddess
of love; also the Court of Love; Spenser's Prothalamion, and Epithalamion,

The Epic of Hades; Thomas Gordon Hake, The Birth of Venus, in New Symbols;

<p><b>35. <i>In Art.</i></b> One of the most famous of ancient paintings was the Venus rising
from the foam, of Apelles. The Venus found (1820) in the island of Melos, or of
Milo (see text, opp. p. <a href="#Page_32">32</a>), now to be seen in the Louvre in Paris, is the work of
some sculptor of about the fourth century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> Some say that the left hand
uplifted held a mirrorlike shield; others, an apple; still others, a trident; and
that the goddess was Amphitrite. A masterpiece of Praxiteles was the Venus
of Cnidos, based upon which are the Venus of the Capitoline in Rome and the
Venus de' Medici in Florence. Also the Venus of the Vatican, which is, in
my opinion, superior to both. The Venus of the Medici was in the possession
of the princes of that name in Rome when, about two hundred years ago, it first
attracted attention. An inscription on the base assigns it to Cleomenes, an
Athenian sculptor of 200 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, but the authenticity of the inscription is doubtful.
There is a story that the artist was employed by public authority to make a statue
exhibiting the perfection of female beauty, and that to aid him in his task the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
most perfect forms the city could supply were furnished him for models. Note
Thomson's allusion in the Summer:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So stands the statue that enchants the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So bending tries to veil the matchless boast,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>And Byron's</p>

<span class="i0">There too the goddess loves in stone, and fills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The air around with beauty.&mdash;Childe Harold, 4, 49-53.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of the most beautiful of the Greek Aphrodites is the Petworth (opp. p. <a href="#Page_126">126</a>,

<p>Of modern paintings the most famous are: the Sleeping Venus and other
representations of Venus by Titian; the Birth of Venus by Bouguereau; Tintoretto's
Cupid, Venus, and Vulcan; Veronese's Venus with Satyr and Cupid.
Modern sculpture: Thorwaldsen's Venus with the Apple; Venus and Cupid;
Cellini's Venus; Canova's Venus Victrix, and the Venus in the Pitti Gallery;
Rossetti's Venus Verticordia (crayons, water colors, oil).</p>

<p><b>36. <i>Interpretative.</i></b> Max M&uuml;ller traces <b>Hermes</b>, child of the Dawn with its fresh
breezes, herald of the gods, spy of the night, to the Vedic Saram&acirc;, goddess of
the Dawn. Others translate Saram&acirc;, <i>storm</i>. Roscher derives from the same
root as Sarameyas (son of Saram&acirc;), with the meaning <i>Hastener</i>, the <i>swift wind</i>.
The invention of the syrinx is attributed also to Pan.</p>

<p><b><i>Illustrative.</i></b> To Mercury's construction of the lyre out of a tortoise shell, Gray
refers (Progress of Poesy), "Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs, Enchanting

to the underworld the spirit of a woman who has just died (text, Fig. 20; from a
relief sculptured on the tomb of Myrrhina), are especially fine specimens of
ancient sculpture.</p>

<p>In modern sculpture: Cellini's Mercury (base of Perseus, Loggia del Lanzi,

(Wednesday), Vatican, Rome; and his Mercury with Psyche (Farnese Frescoes).</p>

<p><b>37. <i>Interpretative.</i></b> The name <b>Hestia</b> (Latin <i>Vesta</i>) has been variously derived
from roots meaning <i>to sit</i>, <i>to stand</i>, <i>to burn</i>. The two former are consistent with
the domestic nature of the goddess; the latter with her relation to the hearth-fire.
She is "first of the goddesses," the holy, the chaste, the sacred.</p>

A Greek Hymn (<i>Cornh. Mag.</i> Vol. 33, 1876); Swinburne, At Eleusis.</p>

<p>The name <i>Ceres</i> is from the stem <i>cer</i>, Sanskrit <i>kri</i>, 'to make.' By metonomy
the word comes to signify <i>corn</i> in the Latin. Demeter (&#915;&#8134; &#956;&#8053;&#964;&#951;&#961;, &#948;&#8118; &#956;&#8049;&#964;&#951;&#961;)
means <i>Mother Earth</i>. The goddess is represented in art crowned with a wheat-measure
(or <i>modius</i>), and bearing a horn of plenty filled with ears of corn.
Demeter (?) appears in the group of deities on the eastern frieze of the Parthenon.
Also noteworthy are the Demeter from Knidos (text, Fig. 29, from the marble
in the British Museum); two statues of Ceres in the Vatican at Rome, and one in
the Glyptothek at Munich; and the Roman wall painting (text, Fig. 30).</p>

<p><b>41. Rhea</b> was worshiped as <b>Cybele</b>, the Great Mother, in Phrygia and at
Pessinus in Galatia. During the Second Punic War, 203 <i>B.C.</i>, her image was
brought from the latter place to Rome. In 191 B.C. the Megalesian Games
were first celebrated in her honor, occupying six days, from the fourth of April
on. Plays were acted during this festival. The Great Mother was also called
Cybebe, Berecyntia, and Dindymene.</p>

<p><b>The Cybele of Art.</b> In works of art, Cybele exhibits the matronly air which distinguishes
Juno and Ceres. Sometimes she is veiled, and seated on a throne with
lions at her side; at other times she rides in a chariot drawn by lions. She wears a
mural crown, that is, a crown whose rim is carved in the form of towers and battlements.
Rhea is mentioned by Homer (Iliad, 15, 187) as the consort of Cronus.</p>

<p><b><i>Illustrative.</i></b> Byron's figure likening Venice to Cybele, Childe Harold, 4, 2,
"She looks a sea-Cybele, fresh from ocean," etc. Also Milton's Arcades, 21.</p>

<p><b>42. <i>Interpretative.</i></b> It is interesting to note that Homer (Iliad and Odyssey)
recognizes Dionysus neither as inventor, nor as exclusive god of wine. In Iliad,
6, 130 he refers, however, to the Dionysus cult in Thrace. Hesiod is the first to
call wine the gift of Dionysus. <b>Dionysus</b> means the Zeus or <i>god</i> of Nysa, an
imaginary vale of Thrace, B&oelig;otia, or elsewhere, in which the deity spent his
youth. The name <b>Bacchus</b> owes its origin to the <i>enthusiasm</i> with which the
followers of the god lifted up their voices in his praise. Similar names are Iacchus,
Bromius, Evius (from the cry <i>evoe</i>). The god was also called Ly&aelig;us, the <i>loosener</i>
of care, Liber, the <i>liberator</i>. His followers are also known as Edonides (from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
Mount Edon, in Thrace, where he was worshiped), Thyiades, the <i>sacrificers</i>,
Len&aelig;a and Bassarides. His festivals were the Lesser and Greater Dionysia (at
Athens), the Len&aelig;a, and the Anthesteria, in December, March, January, and
February, respectively. At the first, three dramatic performances were presented.</p>

<p><i><b>In Art.</b></i> Of ancient representations of the Bacchus, the best examples are the
marble in the British Museum (text, Fig. 31); the Silenus holding the child
Bacchus (in the Louvre); the head of Dionysus found in Smyrna (now in Leyden&mdash;see
text, Fig. 143), from an original of the school of Scopas; the head (now
in London) from the Baths of Caracalla, of the later Attic school; the Faun and
Bacchus (Museum, Naples); a standing bronze figure in Vienna, and the statue
of the Villa Tiburtina (Rome). The bearded or Indian Bacchus is represented
as advanced in years, grave, dignified, crowned with a diadem and robed to the
feet. See also Figs. 82-87, in text.</p>

symbol of inexhaustible riches; but careful discrimination must be observed
between him and Plutus (<i>Ploutos</i>), who is merely an allegorical figure,&mdash;a personification
of wealth and nothing more. <b>Hades</b> is called also the Illustrious, the

<p><b>55.</b> The first love of Zeus was <b>Metis</b>, daughter of Oceanus and Tethys. She is
Prudence or Foreknowledge. She warned Zeus that if she bore him a child, it
would be greater than he. Whereupon Zeus swallowed her; and, in time, from his
head sprang Athene, "the virgin of the azure eyes, Equal in strength, and as her
father wise" (Hesiod, Theog.). On <b>Latona</b>, see <b>32</b>, <b>73</b>, and Commentary.</p>

are indicated in the usual manner (by the sign =, or by parentheses); the more
important characters mentioned in this work are printed in heavy-faced type.
While numerous less important branches, families, and mythical individuals have
been intentionally omitted, it is hoped that this reduction of various relationships,
elsewhere explained or tabulated, to a general scheme, may furnish the reader
with a clearer conception of the family ties that motivate many of the incidents
of mythical adventure, and that must have been commonplaces of information to
those who invented and perpetuated these stories. It should be borne in mind
that the traditions concerning relationships are by no means consistent, and that
consequently the collation of mythical genealogies demands the continual exercise
of discretion, and a balancing of probabilities. Notice that from the union of Jupiter
and Io (Table D), Hercules is descended in the thirteenth generation.</p>

<p><b>Inachus</b> is the principal river of Argolis in the Peloponnesus.</p>

<p><i><b>Interpretative.</b></i> <b>Io</b> is explained as the horned moon, in its various changes and
wanderings. <b>Argus</b> is the heaven with its myriad stars, some of them shut, some
blinking, some always agleam. The wand of Hermes and his music may be the
morning breeze, at the coming of which the eyes of heaven close (Cox, 2, 138;
Preller 2, 40). The explanation would, however, be just as probable if Mercury
(Hermes) were a cloud-driving wind. <b>Pan and the Syrinx</b>: naturally the wind
playing through the reeds, if (with M&uuml;ller and Cox) we take Pan to be the all-purifying,
but yet gentle, wind. But see p. <a href="#Page_181">181</a>.</p>

<p><i><b>Illustrative.</b></i> Shelley, To the Moon, "Art thou pale for weariness Of climbing
heaven and gazing on the earth, Wandering companionless Among the
stars that have a different birth?" Milton's "To behold the wandering moon,
Riding near her highest noon, Like one that had been led astray, Through the
heaven's wide pathless way" (Il Penseroso). See also for Io, Shelley's Prometheus
Bound. <b>Argus</b>: Milton, Paradise Lost, 11, 131; Pope, Dunciad, 2, 374; 4, 637.</p>

<p><b><i>In Art.</i></b> Fig. 47 in the text, from a wall-painting of Herculaneum (Museum,
Naples). Correggio's painting, Jupiter and Io; not a pleasant conception.</p>

<p><b>58. <i>Interpretative.</i></b> The myth of <b>Callisto</b> and <b>Arcas</b> is of Arcadian origin. If
the Arcadians, in very remote times, traced their descent from a she-bear, and if
they also, like other races, recognized a bear in a certain constellation, they
might naturally mix the fables and combine them later with the legend of the all-powerful
Zeus (Lang, 2, 181). According to another account, Callisto was punished
for her love of Jupiter by Diana (Artemis). Her name has been identified with
the adjective <i>Calliste</i>, 'most fair,' which was certainly applied to Artemis herself.
That Artemis was protectress of she-bears is known; also that, in Attica, she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
served by girls who imitated, while dancing, the gait of bears. It is quite possible,
therefore, that Artemis inherited a more ancient worship of the bear that may
have been the <i>totem</i>, or sacred animal, from which the Arcadians traced a mythological
descent. Others hold that the word <i>arksha</i>, 'a star,' became confused with
the Greek <i>arktos</i>, 'a bear.' So the myth of the son Arcas (the star and the bear)
may have arisen (Max M&uuml;ller). The last star in the tail of the Little Bear is the
Polestar, or <b>Cynosure</b> (dog's tail).</p>

<p><b><i>Textual.</i> Moschus</b> lived about the close of the third century B.C. in Syracuse.
He was a grammarian and an idyllic poet. He calls himself a pupil of Bion,&mdash;whose
Lament for Adonis is given in <b>100</b>. Both Bion and Moschus belong to the
School of Theocritus&mdash;the Idyllic or Pastoral School of Poetry. <b>Cypris</b>: Venus,
by whom the island of Cyprus was beloved. <b>Mygdonian flutes</b>: the ancients had
three species or modes of music, depending, respectively, upon the succession
of musical intervals which was adopted as the basis of the system. The Lydian
measures were shrill and lively; the Dorian deep in tone, grave, and solemn; the
Mygdonian, or Phrygian, were supposed by some to have been the same as the
Lydian, but more probably they were a combination of Lydian and Dorian.
<b>Shaker of the World</b>: Neptune. <b>Crete</b>: where Jupiter had been concealed from
his father Cronus, and nourished by the goat Amalthea.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> Herodotus says that <b>Europa</b> was a historical princess of Tyre,
carried off by Hellenes to Crete. <b>Taurus</b> (the bull) was euhemeristically conceived
to be a king of Crete who carried off the Tyrian princess as prize of war. Others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
said that probably the figurehead of the ship in which Europa was conveyed to
Crete was a <i>bull</i>. It is not improbable that the story indicates a settlement of
Ph&oelig;nicians in Crete and the introduction by them of cattle. Modern critics, such
as Preller and Welcker, make Europa a goddess of the moon = Diana or Astarte,
and translate her name "the dark, or obscured one." But she has undoubtedly a
connection with the earth, perhaps as wife of Jupiter (the Heaven). H. D. M&uuml;ller
connects both Io and Europa with the wandering Demeter (or Ceres), and considers
Demeter to be a goddess both of the moon and of the earth (Helbig, in
Roscher). Cox, after his usual method, finds here the Dawn borne across the
heaven by the lord of the pure ether. Europa would then be the broad-spreading
flush of dawn, seen first in the purple region of morning (Ph&oelig;nicia). Her brother
Cadmus, who pursues her, would be the sun searching for his lost sister or bride.
Very fanciful, but inconclusive. <b>The bull</b> occurs not infrequently in myth as an
incarnation of deity.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> According to Preller, <b>Semele</b> is a personification of the fertile
soil in spring, which brings forth the productive vine. In the irrational part of
the myth, Jove takes the child Dionysus (Bacchus), after Semele's death, and sews
him up in his thigh for safe-keeping. Preller finds here "the wedlock of heaven
and earth, the first day that it thunders in March." Exactly why, might be easy
to guess, but hard to demonstrate. The thigh of Jupiter would have to be the cool
moist clouds brooding over the youthful vine. The whole explanation is altogether
too conjectural. See A. Lang's Myth, Ritual, etc., 2, 221-225, for a more plausible
but less poetic theory.</p>

was the discoverer of the river which bears his name. <b>Sisyphus</b>, see <b>255</b>. This
description of the plague is copied by Ovid from the account which Thucydides
gives of the plague of Athens. That account, much fuller than is here given, was
drawn from life and has been the source from which many subsequent poets and
novelists have drawn details of similar scenes. The <b>Myrmidons</b> were, during the
Trojan War, the soldiers of Achilles, grandson of this king &AElig;acus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span></p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> The name <b>&AElig;gina</b> may imply either the shore on which the
waves break (Preller), or the sacred goat (<i>&AElig;geus</i>) which was the <i>totem</i> of
the &AElig;geus family of Attica. The worship of Athene was introduced into Athens
by this family. In sacrifices the goddess was clad in the skin of the sacred goat,
but no goat might be sacrificed to her. Probably another example of the survival
of a savage ritual (Lang, Myth, Ritual, etc., 1, 280).</p>

phenomena would also appear from the significance of the names associated with
hers in the myth: <b>Nycteus</b>, the <i>night-man</i>; <b>Lycus</b>, the <i>man of light</i>. Amphion
and Zethus are thought, in like fashion, to represent manifestations of light; see
also Castor and Pollux. Perhaps the method employed by Zethus and Amphion
in building Thebes may merely symbolize the advantage of combining mechanical
force with well-ordered or harmonious thought.</p>

threw before her an apple, on which these words were inscribed, "I swear by the
sanctuary of Diana to marry Acontius." The maiden read aloud the words and
threw the apple away. But the vow was registered by Diana, who, in spite of many
delays, brought about the marriage of Cydippe and her unknown lover. <b>Polyclitus</b>

or avert evil of any kind, as, for instance, to Apollo and to Thanatos (Death).
See Armstrong's Art of Health, "So P&aelig;an, so the powers of Health command,"
etc., and "the wise of ancient days Adored one power of physic, melody, and
song." <b>P&aelig;ans</b> were chants in honor of Apollo, sung to deprecate misfortune in

The <b>Necklace of Harmonia</b> was a fateful gift. It brought evil to whomsoever it
belonged: to all the descendants of Cadmus; to Eriphyle, wife of Amphiara&uuml;s of
Argos, to whom Polynices gave it; and to the sons of Eriphyle. It was finally
dedicated to Apollo in Delphi. Harmonia's robe possessed the same fatality,

usual period of penance. Apollo, after slaying the Python, had to clear himself of
defilement by a period of purification.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i> Cadmus and his Tyrians</b>: according to the usual explanation,
this myth is based upon an immigration of Ph&oelig;nicians, who settled B&oelig;otia and
gave laws, the rudiments of culture (alphabet, etc.), and industrial arts to the older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
races of Greece. Many Theban names, such as Melicertes, Cadmus, point to a
possible Ph&oelig;nician origin; <i>cf.</i> Semitic Melkarth, and Kedem, the <i>East</i>. But
Preller holds that two mythical personages, a Greek Cadmus and a Ph&oelig;nician
Cadmus, have been confounded; that the Theban Cadmus is merely the representative
of the oldest Theban state; that the selection of the spot on which a
heifer had lain down was a frequent practice among settlers, superstitious about
the site of their new town; that the dragon typifies the cruel and forbidding nature
of the uncultivated surroundings; and that the story of the dragon's teeth was
manufactured to flatter the warlike spirit of the Thebans, the teeth themselves
being spear points.</p>

<p><b>Harmonia</b>, daughter of the patron deities of Thebes, is the symbol of the peace
and domesticity that attend the final establishment of order in the State.</p>

<p>According to the Sun-and-Cloud theory of Cox, Cadmus, the Sun, pursues his
sister, Europa, the broad-flushing light of Dawn, who has been carried off on a
spotless cloud (the Bull). The Sun, of course, must journey farther west than
Crete. The heifer that he is to follow is, therefore, still another cloud (like the
cattle of the Sun,&mdash;clouds). The dragon of Mars is still a third cloud; and this
the Sun dissipates. A storm follows, after which new conflicts arise between the
clouds that have sprung up from the moistened earth (the harvest of armed men!).
This kind of explanation, indiscriminately indulged, delights the fancy of the
inventor and titillates the risibles of the reader.</p>

<p><b>71. <i>Textual.</i> Eurynome</b> is represented by some as one of the Titans, the wife
of Ophion. Ophion and Eurynome, according to one legend, ruled over heaven
before the age of Saturn (Cronus). So Milton, Paradise Lost, 10, 580, "And
fabled how the Serpent, whom they called Ophion, with Eurynome (the wide-Encroaching
Eve perhaps), had first the rule Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn
driven." According to Vulcan's statement (Iliad, 18), Eurynome was daughter of
Oceanus and Tethys. She was mother, by Jupiter, of the Graces. <b>Thetis</b>: see <b>50</b>.
<b>Xanthus</b>: the principal river of Lycia in Asia Minor.</p>

<p><b>72-73. <i>Interpretative.</i> Latona</b> (<b>Leto</b>): according to Homer, one of the deities
of Olympus; a daughter of the Titans C&oelig;us and Ph&oelig;be, whose names indicate
phenomena of radiant light. She belonged, perhaps, to an ancient theogony of
Asia Minor. At any rate she held at one time the rank of lawful wife to Zeus.
Preller and, after him, Cox take Leto as <i>the dusk</i> or <i>darkness</i>. Cox traces the
word to the root of Lethe (the forgetful), but Preller is doubtful. Possibly Leto
and Leda, the mother of the bright Castor and Pollux, have something in common.
The wanderings of Latona may be the weary journey of the night over the
mountain tops, both before and after the Sun (Apollo) is born in Delos (the land
of Dawn).</p>

P&aelig;an, see <b>C. 68</b>. <b>Tityus</b>: an earthborn giant; condemned to the underworld, he
lay stretched over nine acres while two vultures devoured his liver.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i> Python</b>: in many savage myths, a serpent, a frog, or a lizard
that drinks up all the waters, and is destroyed by some national hero or god.
As Mr. Lang says: "Whether the slaying of the Python was or was not originally
an allegory of the defeat of winter by sunlight, it certainly, at a very early period,
became mixed up with ancient legal ideas and local traditions. It is almost as
necessary for a young god or hero to slay monsters as for a young lady to be presented
at court; and we may hesitate to explain all these legends of a useful feat
of courage as nature myths" (Myth, Ritual, etc., 2, 196). Compare the feats of
Hercules, Jason, Bellerophon, Perseus, St. George and the Dragon, Sigurd, and
Jack the Giant Killer. Commentators take Python to be the rigor of winter, or the
darkness of night, or a "black storm-cloud which shuts up the waters" (Cox). It
is not impossible that the Python was the sacred snake of an older animal worship
superseded by that of Apollo. (See also <b>C. 38</b>.)</p>

<p><b>75. <i>Textual.</i></b> The Tyrian hue is purple, made from the juice of the <i>murex</i>, or
purple shellfish. On the leaves of the hyacinth were inscribed characters like
Ai, Ai, the Greek exclamation of woe. It is evidently not our modern hyacinth
that is here described, but perhaps some species of iris, or of larkspur, or pansy.
The meaning of the name is also uncertain, but the best authorities favor <i>youthful</i>.
A festival called the <b>Hyacinthia</b> was celebrated, in commemoration of the
myth, over a large part of the Peloponnesus. It lasted three days, probably in the
first half of July. It consisted of chants of lamentation and fasting during the
first and last days; during the second day, of processions, a horse race, joyous
choral songs, dances, feasting, and sacrifice.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> Most scholars consider Hyacinthus to be the personification
of the blooming vegetation of spring, which withers under the heats of summer.
The Hyacinthian festival seems to have celebrated&mdash;like the Linus festival and
the Eleusinian&mdash;the transitory nature of life and the hope of immortality.</p>

<p><i><b>Interpretative.</b></i> Apollo assumed many of the attributes of Helios, the older
divinity of the sun, who is ordinarily reputed to be the father of Pha&euml;thon (ordinarily
anglicized Pha&euml;ton). The name <i>Pha&euml;thon</i>, like the name <i>Ph&oelig;bus</i>, means
<i>the radiant one</i>. The sun is called both Helios Pha&euml;thon and Helios Ph&oelig;bus
in Homer. It was an easy feat of the imagination to make Pha&euml;thon the incautious
son of Helios, or Apollo, and to suppose that extreme drought is caused by his
careless driving of his father's chariot. The drought is succeeded by a thunderstorm;
and the lightning puts an end to Pha&euml;thon. The rain that succeeds the
lightning is, according to Cox, the tears of the Heliades. It is hardly wise to press
the analogy so far, unless one is prepared to explain the <i>amber</i> in the same way.</p>

Tydeus. The ending <i>-is</i>, in patronymics, means <i>daughter of</i>; as Tyndaris, daughter
of Tyndarus (Tyndareus), Helen; Chryse&iuml;s, daughter of Chryses.</p>

<p><i><b>Interpretative.</b></i> Of this incident Gladstone, in his primer on Homer, says:
"One of the greatest branches and props of morality for the heroic age lay in
the care of the stranger and the poor.... Sacrifice could not be substituted for
duty, nor could prayer. Such, upon the abduction of Chryse&iuml;s, was the reply of
Calchas the Seer: nothing would avail but restitution."</p>

<p><b>Pelops.</b> It is said that the goddess Demeter in a fit of absent-mindedness ate
the shoulder of Pelops. The part was replaced in ivory when Pelops was restored
to life. <b>Mount Cynthus</b>: in Delos, where Apollo and Diana were born.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> Max M&uuml;ller derives <b>Niobe</b> from the root <i>snu</i>, or <i>snigh</i>, from
which come the words for <i>snow</i> in the Indo-European languages. In Latin and
Greek, the stem is <i>Niv</i>, hence Nib, Niobe. The myth, therefore, would signify
the melting of snow and the destruction of its icy offspring under the rays of the
spring sun (Sci. Relig. 372). According to Homer (Iliad, 24, 611), there were six
sons and six daughters. After their death no one could bury them, since all who
looked on them were turned to stone. The burial was, accordingly, performed on
the tenth day after the massacre, by Jupiter and the other gods. This petrifaction
of the onlookers may indicate the operation of the frost. Cox says that Niobe,
the snow, compares her golden-tinted, wintry mists or clouds with the splendor
of the sun and moon. Others look upon the myth as significant of the withering
of spring vegetation under the heats of summer (Preller). The latter explanation
is as satisfactory, for spring is the child of winter (Niobe).</p>

<p><b><i>In Art.</i></b> The restoration of the statue of Niobe, Mount Sipylus; of extreme
antiquity. The St. Petersburg relief (Fig. 61, in text) is probably the best group.
Figs. 60 and 62 are from the ancient marbles in the Uffizi, Florence. The fragments
of the latter group were discovered in 1583 near the Porta San Giovanni,
Rome. The figure of the mother, clasping the little girl who has run to her in
terror, is one of the most admired of the ancient statues. It ranks with the
Laoco&ouml;n and the Apollo Belvedere among the masterpieces of art. The following
is a translation of a Greek epigram supposed to relate to this statue:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To stone the gods have changed her, but in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sculptor's art has made her breathe again.<br /></span>

<p>There is also a fine figure of a daughter of Niobe in the Vatican, Rome; and there
are figures in the Louvre. Reinach in his <i>Apollo</i> attributes the originals to Scopas.</p>

<p><b>79. <i>Interpretative.</i></b> The month in which the festival of <b>Linus</b> took place was
called the <b>Lambs' Month</b>: the days were the <b>Lambs' Days</b>, on one of which was
a massacre of dogs. According to some, Linus was a minstrel, son of Apollo and
the Muse Urania, and the teacher of Orpheus and Hercules.</p>

<p><b>80. Centaurs.</b> Monsters represented as men from the head to the loins, while
the remainder of the body was that of a horse. Centaurs are the only monsters of
antiquity to which any good traits were assigned. They were admitted to the
companionship of men. <b>Chiron</b> was the wisest and justest of the Centaurs. At
his death he was placed by Jupiter among the stars as the constellation Sagittarius
(the Archer). <b>Messenia</b>: in the Peloponnesus. <b>&AElig;sculapius</b>: there were numerous
oracles of &AElig;sculapius, but the most celebrated was at Epidaurus. Here the sick
sought responses and the recovery of their health by sleeping in the temple. It
has been inferred from the accounts that have come down to us that the treatment
of the sick resembled what is now called animal magnetism or mesmerism.</p>

<p>Serpents were sacred to &AElig;sculapius, probably because of a superstition that
those animals have a faculty of renewing their youth by a change of skin. The
worship of &AElig;sculapius was introduced into Rome in a time of great sickness. An
embassy, sent to the temple of Epidaurus to entreat the aid of the god, was propitiously
received; and on the return of the ship &AElig;sculapius accompanied it in
the form of a serpent. Arriving in the river Tiber, the serpent glided from the
vessel and took possession of an island, upon which a temple was soon erected
to his honor.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> The healing powers of nature may be here symbolized. But it
is more likely that the family of Asclepiad&aelig; (a medical clan) invented Asklepios
as at once their ancestor and the son of the god of healing, Apollo.</p>

<p><b>81. <i>Interpretative.</i></b> Perhaps the unceasing and unvarying round of the sun led
to the conception of him as a servant. Max M&uuml;ller cites the Peruvian Inca who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
said that if the sun were free, like fire, he would visit new parts of the heavens.
"He is," said the Inca, "like a tied beast who goes ever round and round in the
same track" (Chips, etc., 2, 113). Nearly all Greek heroes had to undergo servitude,&mdash;Hercules,
Perseus, etc. No stories are more beautiful or more lofty than those
which express the hope, innate in the human heart, that somewhere and at some
time some god has lived as a man among men and for the good of men. Such
stories are not confined to the Greeks or the Hebrews.</p>

Penelope and Laodamia, the latter of whom was her niece. To explain the myth
as a physical allegory would be easy, but is it not more likely that the idea of
<i>substitution</i> finds expression in the myth?&mdash;that idea of atonement by sacrifice,
which is suggested in the words of &OElig;dipus at Colonus (<b>185</b>), "For one soul working

<p><b>89. <i>Textual.</i></b> Daphne was a sister of Cyrene, another sweetheart of Apollo's
(<b>145</b>). <b>Delphi</b>, in Phocis, and <b>Tenedos</b>, an island off the coast of Asia Minor,
near Troy, were celebrated for their temples of Apollo. The latter temple was
sacred to <b>Apollo Smintheus</b>, the Mouse-Apollo, probably because he had rid
that country of mice as St. Patrick rid Ireland of snakes and toads. <b>Dido</b>: queen
of Carthage (<b>252</b>), whose lover, &AElig;neas, sailed away from her.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> Max M&uuml;ller's explanation is poetic though not philologically
probable. "Daphne, or Ahan&acirc;, means the Dawn. There is first the appearance
of the dawn in the eastern sky, then the rising of the sun as if hurrying after his
bride, then the gradual fading away of the bright dawn at the touch of the fiery
rays of the sun, and at last her death or disappearance in the lap of her mother,
the earth." The word <i>Daphne</i> also means, in Greek, a <i>laurel</i>; hence the legend
that Daphne was changed into a laurel tree (Sci. Relig., 378, 379). Others construe
Daphne as the <i>lightning</i>. It is, however, very probable that the Greeks of
the myth-making age, finding certain plants and flowers sacred to Apollo, would
invent stories to explain why he preferred the laurel, the hyacinth, the sunflower,
etc. "Such myths of metamorphoses" are, as Mr. Lang says, "an universal growth
of savage fancy, and spring from a want of a sense of difference between men
and things" (Myth, Ritual, etc., 2, 206).</p>

<p><b>93. <i>Textual.</i> Elis</b>: northwestern part of the Peloponnesus. <b>Alphe&uuml;s</b>: a
river of Elis flowing to the Mediterranean. The river Alphe&uuml;s does in fact
disappear under ground, in part of its course, finding its way through subterranean
channels, till it again appears on the surface. It was said that the Sicilian
fountain Arethusa was the same stream, which, after passing under the sea, came
up again in Sicily. Hence the story ran that a cup thrown into the Alphe&uuml;s
appeared again in the Arethusa. It is, possibly, this fable of the underground
course of Alphe&uuml;s that Coleridge has in mind in his dream of Kubla Khan:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through caverns measureless to man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Down to a sunless sea.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In one of Moore's juvenile poems he alludes to the practice of throwing garlands
or other light objects on the stream of Alphe&uuml;s, to be carried downward
by it, and afterward reproduced at its emerging, "as an offering To lay at
Arethusa's feet."</p>

<p><b>The Acroceraunian Mountains</b> are in Epirus in the northern part of Greece.
It is hardly necessary to point out that a river Arethusa arising there could not
possibly be approached by an Alphe&uuml;s of the Peloponnesus. Such a criticism of
Shelley's sparkling verses would however be pedantic rather than just. Probably
Shelley uses the word <i>Acroceraunian</i> as synonymous with <i>steep</i>, <i>dangerous</i>. If so,
he had the practice of Ovid behind him (Remedium Amoris, 739). <b>Mount Erymanthus</b>:
between Arcadia and Achaia. The <b>Dorian</b> deep: the Peloponnesus

stood a famous statue of Venus, attributed to Praxiteles. <b>Cytherea</b>: Venus, an
adjective derived from her island Cythera in the &AElig;gean Sea. <b>Acheron</b>, and <b>Persephone</b>
or <b>Proserpine</b>: see <b>44-48</b>. The wind-flower of the Greeks was of bloody
hue, like that of the pomegranate. It is said the wind blows the blossoms open,
and afterwards scatters the petals.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> Among the P&oelig;nicians Venus is known as Astarte, among the
Assyrians as Istar. The <b>Adonis</b> of this story is the Ph&oelig;nician <i>Adon</i>, or the
Hebrew <i>Adonai</i>, 'Lord.' The myth derives its origin from the Babylonian worship
of Thammuz or Adon, who represents the verdure of spring, and whom his
mistress, the goddess of fertility, seeks, after his death, in the lower regions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
With their departure all birth and fruitage cease on the earth; but when he has
been revived by sprinkling of water, and restored to his mistress and to earth, all
nature again rejoices. The myth is akin to those of Linus, Hyacinthus, and Narcissus.
Mannhardt (Wald-und Feld-kulte, 274), cited by Roscher, supplies the
following characteristics common to such religious rites in various lands: (1) The
spring is personified as a beautiful youth who is represented by an image surrounded
by quickly fading flowers from the "garden of Adonis." (2) He comes
in the early year and is beloved by a goddess of vegetation, goddess sometimes
of the moon, sometimes of the star of Love. (3) In midsummer he dies, and during
autumn and winter inhabits the underworld. (4) His burial is attended with
lamentations, his resurrection with festivals. (5) These events take place in midsummer
and in spring. (6) The image and the <i>Adonis</i> plants are thrown into
water. (7) Sham marriages are celebrated between pairs of worshipers.</p>

<p><b>101-102. <i>Textual.</i> Psyche</b> does not eat anything in Hades, because, by accepting
the hospitality of Proserpina, she would become an inmate of her household.

ancient matrimonial custom. <b>Erebus</b>: the land of darkness, Hades. For <b>Zephyr</b>,
<b>Acheron</b>, <b>Cerberus</b>, <b>Charon</b>, etc., see Index.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> The fable of Cupid and Psyche is usually regarded as allegorical.
The Greek name for <i>butterfly</i> is Psyche, and the same word means the <i>soul</i>.
There is no illustration of the immortality of the soul so striking and beautiful as
that of the butterfly, bursting on brilliant wings from the tomb in which it has
lain, after a dull, groveling, caterpillar existence, to flutter in the blaze of day
and feed on the most fragrant and delicate productions of the spring. Psyche,
then, is the human soul, which is purified by sufferings and misfortunes, and is
thus prepared for the enjoyment of true and pure happiness. It is probable that
the story allegorizes a philosophical conception concerning <i>three</i> stages of the
soul's life: first, a former existence of bliss; second, an earthly existence of trial;
third, a heavenly future of fruition. Cox, by his usual method, finds here a myth
of the search for the Sun (Eros) by the Dawn (Psyche). Many of the incidents
of the story will be found in modern fairy tales and romances, such as Beauty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
the Beast, Grimm's Twelve Brothers; the Gaelic stories: The Three Daughters of

not more than a mile, but there is a constant dangerous current setting out from
the Sea of Marmora into the Archipelago. For an allusion to the story see Byron,

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> On the supposition that the herds of Apollo are the bright rays
of the sun, a plausible physical explanation of the relations of <b>Mercury</b> (Hermes)
to Apollo is the following from Max M&uuml;ller: "Hermes is the god of the twilight,
who betrays his equivocal nature by stealing, though only in fun, the herds of
Apollo, but restoring them without the violent combat that (in the analogous
Indian story) is waged for the herds between Indra, the bright god, and Vala, the
robber. In India the dawn brings the light; in Greece the twilight itself is supposed
to have stolen it, or to hold back the light, and Hermes, the twilight, surrenders
the booty when challenged by the sun-god Apollo" (Lect. on Lang.,
2 Ser., 521-522). Hermes is connected by Professor M&uuml;ller with the Vedic god
<i>Sarameya</i>, son of the twilight. Mercury, or Hermes, as morning or as evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
twilight, loves the Dew, is herald of the gods, is spy of the night, is sender of
sleep and dreams, is accompanied by the cock, herald of dawn, is the guide of the
departed on their last journey. To the conception of twilight, Cox adds that of
<i>motion</i>, and explains Hermes as the <i>air in motion</i> that springs up with the dawn,
gains rapidly in force, sweeps before it the <i>clouds</i> (here the cattle of Apollo),
makes soft music through the trees (lyre), etc. Other theorists make Hermes the
Divine Activity, the god of the ether, of clouds, of storm, etc. Though the explanations
of Professor M&uuml;ller and the Rev. Sir G. W. Cox are more satisfactory
here than usual, Roscher's <i>the swift wind</i> is scientifically preferable.</p>

capital of B&oelig;otia. <b>M&aelig;onia</b>: Lydia, in Asia Minor. <b>Dia</b>: Naxos, the largest of
the Cyclades Islands in the &AElig;gean. <b>Mount Cith&aelig;ron</b>: in B&oelig;otia. The <b>Thyrsus</b>
was a wand, wreathed with ivy and surmounted by a pine cone, carried by Bacchus
and his votaries. <b>M&aelig;nads</b> and <b>Bacchantes</b> were female followers of Bacchus.
<b>Bacchanal</b> is a general term for his devotees.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> "<b>Bacchus</b> (Dionysus) is regarded by many as the <i>spiritual form</i>
of the new vernal life, the sap and pulse of vegetation and of the new-born year,
especially as manifest in the vine and juice of the grape."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lang</span>, Myth, Ritual,
etc., 2, 221 (from Preller 1, 554). The <b>Hyades</b> (rain-stars), that nurtured the
deity, perhaps symbolize the rains that nourish sprouting vegetation. He became
identified very soon with the <i>spirituous effects</i> of the vine. His sufferings may typify
the "ruin of the summer year at the hands of storm and winter," or, perhaps, the
agony of the bleeding grapes in the wine press. The orgies would, according to this
theory, be a survival of the ungoverned actions of savages when celebrating a festival
in honor of the deity of plenty, of harvest home, and of intoxication. But in cultivated
Greece, Dionysus, in spite of the surviving orgiastic ceremonies, is a poetic
incarnation of blithe, changeable, spirited youth. See Lang, Myth, Ritual, etc., 2,
221-241. That <b>Rhea</b> taught him would account for the Oriental nature of his
rites; for Rhea is an Eastern deity by origin. The opposition of <b>Pentheus</b> would
indicate the reluctance with which the Greeks adopted his doctrine and ceremonial.
The Dionysiac worship came from Thrace, a barbarous clime;&mdash;but
wandering, like the springtide, over the earth, Bacchus conquered each nation in
turn. It is probable that the Dionysus-Iacchus cult was one of evangelical enthusiasm
and individual cleansing from sin, of ideals in this life and of personal
immortality in the next. By introducing it into Greece, Pisistratus reformed the
exclusive ritual of the Eleusinian Mysteries.</p>

<p>Of the <b>Festivals of Dionysus</b>, the more important in Attica were the Lesser
Dionysia, in December; the Len&aelig;a, in January; the Anthesteria, or spring festival,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
in February; and the Great Dionysia, in March. These all, in greater or less
degree, witnessed of the culture and the glories of the vine, and of the reawakening
of the spirits of vegetation. They were celebrated, as the case might be, with
a sacrifice of a victim in reminiscence of the blood by which the spirits of the
departed were supposed to be nourished, with processions of women, profusion
of flowers, orgiastic songs and dances, or dramatic representations.</p>

son of one Gordius, who from a farmer had become king of Phrygia, because he
happened to fulfill a prophecy by entering the public square of some city just as
the people were casting about for a king. He tied his wagon in the temple of the
prophetic deity with the celebrated <b>Gordian Knot</b>, which none but the future lord
of Asia might undo. Alexander the Great undid the knot with his sword.</p>

<p><i><b>Interpretative.</b></i> An ingenious, but not highly probable, theory explains the
golden touch of Midas as the rising sun that gilds all things, and his bathing in
Pactolus as the quenching of the sun's splendor in the western ocean. <b>Midas</b> is
fabled to have been the son of the "great mother," Cybele, whose worship in
Phrygia was closely related to that of Bacchus or Dionysus. The <b>Sileni</b> were
there regarded as tutelary <i>genii</i> of the rivers and springs, promoting fertility of
the soil. <b>Marsyas</b>, an inspired musician in the service of Cybele, was naturally
associated in fable with Midas. The ass being the favorite animal of Silenus, the
ass's ears of Midas merely symbolize his fondness for and devotion to such habits as
were attributed to the Sileni. The ass, by the way, was reverenced in Phrygia; the
acquisition of ass's ears may therefore have been originally a glory, not a disgrace.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> The Italian goddess Ceres assumed the attributes of the Greek
Demeter in 496 B.C. Proserpine signifies the seed-corn which, when cast into the
ground, lies there concealed,&mdash;is carried off by the god of the underworld;
when the corn reappears, Proserpine is restored to her mother. Spring leads
her back to the light of day. The following, from Aubrey De Vere's Introduction
to his Search for Proserpine, is suggestive: "Of all the beautiful fictions of
Greek Mythology, there are few more exquisite than the story of Proserpine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
none deeper in symbolical meaning. Considering the fable with reference to the
physical world, Bacon says, in his Wisdom of the Ancients, that by the Rape of
Proserpine is signified the disappearance of flowers at the end of the year, when
the vital juices are, as it were, drawn down to the central darkness, and held there
in bondage. Following up this view of the subject, the Search of her Mother,
sad and unavailing as it was, would seem no unfit emblem of Autumn and the
restless melancholy of the season; while the hope with which the Goddess was
finally cheered may perhaps remind us of that unexpected return of fine weather
which occurs so frequently, like an omen of Spring, just before Winter closes in.
The fable has, however, its moral significance also, being connected with that
great mystery of Joy and Grief, of Life and Death, which pressed so heavily on
the mind of Pagan Greece, and imparts to the whole of her mythology a profound
interest, spiritual as well as philosophical. It was the restoration of Man, not of
flowers, the victory over Death, not over Winter, with which that high Intelligence
felt itself to be really concerned." In Greece two kinds of <b>Festivals</b>, the <b>Eleusinia</b>
and the <b>Thesmophoria</b>, were held in honor of Demeter and Persephone. The
former was divided into the lesser, celebrated in February, and the greater (lasting
nine days), in September. Distinction must be made between the Festivals and
the Mysteries of Eleusis. In the Festivals all classes might participate. Those of
the Spring represented the restoration of Persephone to her mother; those of the
Autumn the rape of Persephone. An image of the youthful Iacchus (Bacchus)
headed the procession in its march toward Eleusis. At that place and in the
neighborhood were enacted in realistic fashion the wanderings and the sufferings
of Demeter, the scenes in the house of Celeus, and finally the successful conclusion
of the search for Persephone. The <b>Mysteries</b> of Eleusis were witnessed
only by the initiated, and were invested with a veil of secrecy which has never
been fully withdrawn. The initiates passed through certain symbolic ceremonies
from one degree of mystic enlightenment to another till the highest was attained.
The Lesser Mysteries were an introduction to the Greater; and it is known that
the rites involved partook of the nature of purification from passion, crime, and
the various degradations of human existence. By pious contemplation of the
dramatic scenes presenting the sorrows of Demeter, and by participation in sacramental
rites, it is probable that the initiated were instructed in the nature of life
and death, and consoled with the hope of immortality (Preller). On the development
of the Eleusinian Mysteries from the savage to the civilized ceremonial, see
Lang, Myth, Ritual, etc., 2, 275, and Lobeck, Aglaophamus, 133.</p>

<p>The <b>Thesmophoria</b> were celebrated by married women in honor of Ceres
(Demeter), and referred to institutions of married life.</p>

<p>That Proserpine should be under bonds to the underworld because she had
partaken of food in Hades accords with a superstition not peculiar to the
Greeks, but to be "found in New Zealand, Melanesia, Scotland, Finland, and
among the Ojibbeways" (Lang, Myth, Ritual, etc., 2, 273).</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i> The loss of Eurydice</b> may signify (like the death of Adonis and
the rape of Proserpine) the departure of spring. Max M&uuml;ller, however, identifies
<i>Orpheus</i> with the Sanskrit <i>Arbhu</i>, used as a name for the Sun (Chips, etc., 2, 127).
According to this explanation the Sun follows Eurydice, "the
wide-spreading
flush of the dawn who has been stung by the serpent of night," into the regions
of darkness. There he recovers Eurydice, but while he looks back upon her she
fades before his gaze, as the mists of morning vanish before the glory of the
rising sun (Cox). It might be more consistent to construe <i>Eurydice</i> as the <i>twilight</i>,
first, of evening which is slain by night, then, of morning which is dissipated by
sunrise. Cox finds in the music of Orpheus the delicious strains of the breezes
which accompany sunrise and sunset. The story should be compared with that
of Apollo and Daphne, and of Mercury and Apollo. The Irish tale, The Three
Daughters of King O'Hara, reverses the relation of Orpheus and Eurydice.

<p><b>123-124. <i>Textual.</i> Cephalus</b>, the son of Mercury (Hermes) and Herse, is
irretrievably confounded with Cephalus, the son of De&iuml;on and grandson of

(Eos); the latter is the husband of Procris, and the great-grandfather of Ulysses.
(See Tables H, I, and O (4).)</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i> Procris</b> is the dewdrop (from Greek <i>Pr&#x014D;x</i>, 'dew') which reflects
the shining rays of the sun. The "head of the day," or the rising sun, Cephalus,
is also wooed by Aurora, the Dawn, but flies from her. The Sun slays the dew
with the same gleaming darts that the dew reflects, or gives back to him. According
to Preller, Cephalus is the morning-star beloved alike by Procris, the moon,
and by Aurora, the dawn. The concealment of Procris in the forest and her
death would, then, signify the paling of the moon before the approaching day.
Hardly so probable as the former explanation.</p>

serpents, and <b>Phantasus</b>, who assumes the forms of
rocks, streams, and other inanimate things.</p>

<p>The accompanying table will indicate the connections
and descendants of Aurora.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> According to one account, <b>Ceyx</b> and
<b>Halcyone</b>, by likening their wedded happiness to that
of Jupiter and Juno, incurred the displeasure of the
gods. The myth springs from observation of the habits
of the Halcyone-bird, which nests on the strand and
is frequently bereft of its young by the winter waves.
The comparison with the glory of Jupiter and Juno is
suggested by the splendid iris hues of the birds.
Halcyone days have become proverbial as seasons of
calm. <b>&AElig;olus I</b>, the son of Hellen, is here identified
with <b>&AElig;olus III</b>, the king of the winds. According to
Diodorus, the latter is a descendant, in the fifth generation,
of the former. (See Genealogical Table I.)</p>

<p><b>126-127. <i>Interpretative.</i> Tithonus</b> may be the day
in its ever-recurring circuit of morning freshness, noon
heat, final withering and decay (Preller); or the gray
glimmer of the heavens overspread by the first ruddy
flush of morning (Welcker); or, as a solar myth, the
sun in his setting and waning,&mdash;<i>Tithonus</i> meaning,
by derivation, the illuminator (Max M&uuml;ller). The
sleep of Tithonus in his ocean-bed, and his transformation
into a grasshopper, would then typify the presumable
weariness and weakness of the sun at night.</p>

some doubt about the identification of the existing
statue with that described by the ancients, and the
mysterious sounds are still more doubtful. Yet there
is not wanting modern testimony to their being still
audible. It has been suggested that sounds produced
by confined air making its escape from crevices or
caverns in the rocks may have given some ground for the story. Sir Gardner
Wilkinson, a traveler of the highest authority, examined the statue itself, and
discovered that it was hollow, and that "in the lap of the statue is a stone, which,
on being struck, emits a metallic sound that might still be made use of to deceive
a visitor who was predisposed to believe its powers."</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i> Memnon</b> is generally represented as of dark features, lighted
with the animation of glorious youth. He is king of the mythical &AElig;thiopians who
lived in the land of gloaming, where east and west met, and whose name signifies
"dark splendor." His birth in this borderland of light and darkness signifies either
his existence as king of an eastern land or his identity with the young sun, and
strengthens the theory according to which his father Tithonus is the gray glimmer
of the morning heavens. The flocks of birds have been explained as the glowing
clouds that meet in battle over the body of the dead sun.</p>

the succession of the seasons and the changing characteristics of each. The name
itself implies <i>turning</i>, or <i>change</i>.</p>

<p><b>140. <i>Textual.</i></b> In order to understand the story of Ibycus, it is necessary to
remember, first, that the theaters of the ancients were immense fabrics, capable
of containing from ten to thirty thousand spectators, and as they were used only
on festal occasions and admission was free to all, they were usually filled. They
were without roofs and open to the sky, and performances were in the daytime.
Secondly, that the appalling representation of the Furies is not exaggerated in
the story. It is fabled that &AElig;schylus, the tragic poet, having on one occasion
represented the Furies in a chorus of fifty performers, the terror of the spectators
was such that many fainted and were thrown into convulsions, and the magistrates
forbade a like representation for the future (Pollux, 4, 110). Usually the chorus
in a single tragedy consisted of only fifteen performers.</p>

Cranes of Ibycus, by E. A. Bowring.</p>

<p><b>141. <i>Textual.</i></b> The adventures of the water-divinities turn largely on the idea
of metamorphosis, which would readily be suggested to the imaginative mind by
contemplation of the ever-changing aspect of fountain, stream, lake, or ocean.
For genealogies of water-deities, see Table C.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> The Cyclops, <b>Polyphemus</b>, does not possess much in common
with Steropes, Brontes, and Arges, the offspring of Uranus and G&aelig;a, save his one
eye and his monstrous size. The sons of G&aelig;a are personifications of thunder and
lightning; Polyphemus is the heavy vapor that rolls its clouds along the hillside.
The clouds are the sheep that he pastures; the sun glowering through the vapor
is his single eye (Cox). More probably he is a mere giant of folklore.</p>

descent, see Table C. See Keats, Endymion, Bk. 3.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> Glaucus is explained by some as the calm gleaming sea; by
others, as the angry sea that reflects the lowering heavens (see Roscher, p. 1690).
Scylla is a personification of treacherous currents and shallows among jagged
cliffs and hidden rocks.</p>

dews embalmed The Earth" (Milton, Paradise Lost, 11, 135).</p>

<p><b>145. Cyrene</b> was sister to Daphne. Honey must first have been known as a
wild product, the bees building their structures in hollow trees, or holes in the
rocks, or any similar cavity that chance offered. Thus occasionally the carcass of
a dead animal would be occupied by the bees for that purpose. It was no doubt
from some such incident that the superstition arose that bees were engendered
by the decaying flesh of the animal. Virgil assigns to Proteus the isle of Carpathus,
between Crete and Rhodes; Homer, the isle of Pharus, near the
river Nile.</p>

<p><b><i>Illustrative.</i></b> See <b>C. 50</b>. Proteus, a poem by R. Buchanan. On <b>Arist&aelig;us</b>,

Cyrene's palace. Milton probably thought of Cyrene in describing Sabrina
(Comus). He calls Proteus "the Carpathian Wizard."</p>

<p><b>146-147. <i>Textual.</i> Achelo&uuml;s</b>: the largest river in Greece, rose in Mount Lacmon,
flowed between Acarnania and &AElig;tolia, and emptied into the Ionian Sea. It
was honored over all Greece. <b>Calydon</b>: a city of &AElig;tolia, famed for the Calydonian
Hunt. <b>Parthenope</b>, see <b>238. Ligea</b> (Ligeia): the <i>shrill-sounding maiden</i>;
here a Siren; sometimes a Dryad.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> Even among the ancients such stories as this were explained
on a physical basis: the river Achelo&uuml;s flows through the realm of Dejanira,
hence Achelo&uuml;s loves Dejanira. When the river winds it is a snake, when it
roars it is a bull, when it overflows its banks it puts forth new horns. Hercules is
supposed to have regulated the course of the stream by confining it within a new
and suitable channel. At the same time the old channel, redeemed from the
stream, subjected to cultivation, and blossoming with flowers, might well be called
a <i>horn of plenty</i>. There is another account of the origin of the Cornucopia. Jupiter
at his birth was committed by his mother Rhea to the care of the daughters of
Melisseus, a Cretan king. They fed the infant deity with the milk of the goat
Amalthea. Jupiter, breaking off one of the horns of the goat, gave it to his nurses,
and endowed it with the power of becoming filled with whatever the possessor
might wish.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> While <b>Dana&uuml;s</b> is, in fact, a native mythical hero of Argos, the
story of his arrival from Egypt is probably an attempt to explain the influence of
Egyptian civilization upon the Greeks. The name <i>Dana&uuml;s</i> means <i>drought</i>, and
may refer to the frequently dry condition of the soil of Argos. The fifty daughters
of Dana&uuml;s would then be the nymphs of the many <i>springs</i> which in season refresh
the land of Argolis. Their suitors, the fifty sons of &AElig;gyptus, would be the streams
of Argolis that in the rainy months threaten to overflow their banks. But the
springs by vanishing during the hot weather deprive the streams of water and
consequently of life. That is to say, when the sources (Dana&iuml;ds) choose to stop
supplies, the heads of the streams (the fifty youths of Argolis) are cut off. The
reference to &AElig;gyptus and the sons of &AElig;gyptus would indicate a reminiscence
of the Nile and its tributaries, alternately overflowing and exhausted. The unsuccessful
toil of the Dana&iuml;ds in Tartarus may have been suggested by the sandy
nature of the Argive soil, and the leaky nature of the springs, now high, now
low. Or it may typify, simply, any incessant, fruitless labor. The name <b>Hypermnestra</b>
signifies <i>constancy</i> and <i>love</i>. <b>Dana&euml;</b>, the daughter of Acrisius, has been
regarded as the dry earth, which under the rains of the golden springtime bursts
into verdure and bloom; or as the dark depths of the earth; or as the dawn,
from which, shot through with the golden rays of heaven, the youthful Sun is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
born.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> Advocates of the last theory would understand the voyage of Dana&euml; and
Perseus as the tossing of the sunbeams on the waters of the eastern horizon.
The young Sun would next overcome the <b>Gray-women</b>, forms of the gloaming,
and then slay with his sword of light the black cloud of the heavenly vault, the
<b>Gorgon</b>, whose aspect is night and death.</p>

<p>The <b>Gr&aelig;&aelig;</b> and the Gorgons may, with greater probability, be taken as personifications
of the hidden horrors of the unknown night-enveloped ocean and
the misty horizon whence storms come. In that case the Gr&aelig;&aelig; will be the gray
clouds, and their one tooth (or one eye) the harmless gleam of the lightning; the
Gorgons will be the heavy thunderclouds, and their petrifying gaze the swift and
fatal lightning flash.</p>

<p>But there are still others who find in the Gorgon <b>Medusa</b> the wan visage of
the moon, empress of the night, slain by the splendor of morning. The sandals
of Hermes have, accordingly, been explained as the morning breeze, or even as
the chariot of the sun. The invisible helmet may be the clouds under which the sun
disappears. Compare the cloak of darkness in the Three Daughters of King
O'Hara; and the Sword of Sharpness in the Weaver's Son and the Giant of White
Hill (Curtin, Myths of Ireland).</p>

<p><b>Andromeda</b> is variously deciphered: the tender dawn, which a storm-cloud
would obscure and devour; the moon, which darkness, as a dragon, threatens to
swallow; or some historic character that has passed into myth. Compare the contests
of Perseus and the Dragon, Apollo and Pytho, Hercules and the Serpents,
Cadmus and the Dragon of Mars, St. George and the Dragon, Siegfried and the
Worm (Fafnir). For a Gaelic Andromeda and Perseus, see The Thirteenth Son
of the King of Erin (Curtin, Myths of Ireland).</p>

<p>Perseus' flight to the <b>Gardens of the Hesperides</b> suggests, naturally, the circuit
of the sun toward the flushing western horizon; and, of course, he would here
behold the giant <b>Atlas</b>, who, stationed where heaven and earth meet, sustains
upon his shoulders the celestial vault.</p>

<p>The <b>Doom of Acrisius</b> reminds one of that of Hyacinthus. The quoit suggests
the rays of the sun, and the name <i>Acrisius</i> may be construed to mean the "confused
or gloomy heavens" (Roscher, Preller, M&uuml;ller, etc.).</p>

<p><b>Lycia</b>: in Asia Minor. The fountain <b>Hippocrene</b>, on the Muses' mountain,
Helicon, was opened by a kick from the hoof of Pegasus. This horse belongs to
the Muses, and has from time immemorial been ridden by the poets. From the
story of Bellerophon being unconsciously the bearer of his own death-warrant,
the expression "<b>Bellerophontic letters</b>" arose, to describe any species of communication
which a person is made the bearer of, containing matter prejudicial to
himself. <b>Aleian field</b>: a district in Cilicia (Asia Minor).</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i> Bellerophon</b> is either "he who appears in the clouds," or "he
who slays the cloudy monster." In either sense we have another sun-myth and
sun-hero. He is the son of Glaucus, who, whether he be descended from Sisyphus
or from Neptune, is undoubtedly a sea-god. His horse, sprung from Medusa, the
thundercloud, when she falls under the sword of the sun, is <b>Pegasus</b>, the rain-cloud.
In his contest with the <b>Chim&aelig;ra</b> we have a repetition of the combat of Perseus
and the sea monster. Bellerophon is a heavenly knight errant who slays the powers
of storm and darkness. The earth, struck by his horse's hoof, bubbles into springs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
(Rapp in Roscher, and Max M&uuml;ller). At the end of the day, falling from heaven,
this knight of the sun walks in melancholy the pale fields of the twilight.</p>

<p><b>Pillars of Hercules.</b> The chosen device of Charles V of Germany represented
the Pillars of Hercules entwined by a scroll that bore his motto, "Plus Ultra"
(still farther). This device, imprinted upon the German dollar, has been adopted
as the sign of the American dollar ($). <i>Dollar</i>, by the way, means <i>coin of the</i>
<i>valley</i>,&mdash;German <i>Thal</i>. The silver of the first dollars came from Joachimsthal in
Bohemia, about 1518. <b>Hesperides</b>: the western sky at sunset. The apples may
have been suggested by stories of the oranges of Spain. The <b>Cacus</b> myth is
thoroughly latinized, but of Greek origin. The <b>Aventine</b>: one of the hills of
Rome. <b>Colchis</b>: in Asia, east of the Euxine and south of Caucasus. <b>Mysia</b>:
province of Asia Minor, north of Lydia. The river <b>Phasis</b> flows through Colchis
into the Euxine. For genealogy of <b>Laomedon</b>, see Table O (5). <b>Pylos</b>: it is
doubtful what city is intended. There were two such towns in Elis, and one in
Messenia. The word means <i>gate</i> (see Iliad, 5, 397), and in the case of Hercules
there may be some reference to his journey to the gate or <i>Pylos</i> of Hades. For
<b>Alcestis</b>, see <b>83</b>; for <b>Prometheus</b>, <b>15</b>; for the family of Dejanira, Table K. <b>Alcides</b>:
<i>i.e.</i> Hercules, descendant of Alc&aelig;us. <b>&OElig;chalia</b>: in Thessaly or in Eub&oelig;a. <b>Mount</b>
<b>&OElig;ta</b>: in Thessaly. The <b>Pygmies</b>: a nation of dwarfs, so called from a Greek
word meaning the cubit, or measure of about thirteen inches, which was said to
be the height of these people. They lived near the sources of the Nile, or, according
to others, in India. Homer tells us that the cranes used to migrate every
winter to the Pygmies' country, where, attacking the cornfields, they precipitated
war. H. M. Stanley, in his last African expedition, discovered a race of diminutive
men that correspond fairly in appearance with those mentioned by Homer. The
<b>Cercopes</b>: the subject of a comic poem by Homer, and of numerous grotesque
representations in Greek literature and sculpture.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i></b> All myths of the sun represent that luminary as struggling
against and overcoming monsters, or performing other laborious tasks in obedience
to the orders of some tyrant of inferior spirit, but of legal authority. Since
the life of Hercules is composed of such tasks, it is easy to class him with other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
sun-heroes. But to construe his whole history and all his feats as symbolic of the
sun's progress through the heavens, beginning with the labors performed in his
eastern home and ending with the capture of Cerberus in the underworld beyond
the west, or to construe the subjects of the twelve labors as consciously recalling the
twelve signs of the Zodiac is not only unwarranted, but absurd. To some extent
Hercules is a sun-hero; to some extent his adventures are fabulous history; to a
greater extent both he and his adventures are the product of generations of
&aelig;sthetic, but primitive and fanciful, invention. The same statement holds true of
nearly all the heroes and heroic deeds of mythology. As a matter of interest, it
may be noted that the serpents that attacked Hercules in his cradle are explained
as powers of darkness which the sun destroys, and the cattle that he tended, as
the clouds of morning. His choice between pleasure and duty at the outset of
his career enforces, of course, a lesson of conduct. His lion's skin may denote
the tawny cloud which the sun trails behind him as he fights his way through the
vapors that he overcomes (Cox). The slaughter of the Centaurs may be the dissipation
of these vapors. His insanity may denote the raging heat of the sun at
noonday. The Nemean lion may be a monster of cloud or darkness; the Hydra,
a cloud that confines the kindly rains, or at times covers the heavens with numerous
necks and heads of vapor. The Cerynean Stag may be a golden-tinted cloud
that the sun chases; and the Cattle of the Augean stables, clouds that, refusing to
burst in rain, consign the earth to drought and filth. The Erymanthian boar and
the Cretan bull are probably varied forms of the powers of darkness; so also the
Stamphalian (Stymphalian) birds and the giant Cacus. Finally, the scene of the
hero's death is a "picture of a sunset in wild confusion, the multitude of clouds
hurrying hither and thither, now hiding, now revealing the mangled body of the
sun." In this way Cox, and other interpreters of myth, would explain the series.
But while the explanations are entertaining and poetic, their very plausibility
should suggest caution in accepting them. It is not safe to construe all the details
of a mythical career in terms of any one theory. The more noble side of the
character of Hercules presents itself to the moral understanding, as worthy of
consideration and admiration. The dramatist Euripides has portrayed him as a
great-hearted hero, high-spirited and jovial, rejoicing in the vigor of manhood,
comforting the downcast, wrestling with Death and overcoming him, restoring
happiness where sorrow had obtained. No grander conception of manliness has in
modern times found expression in poetry than that of the Hercules in Browning's
transcript of Euripides, Balaustion's Adventure.</p>

<p><b><i>Interpretative.</i> Argo</b> means <i>swift</i>, or <i>white</i>, or commemorates the ship-builder,
or the city of Argos. The Argo-myth rests upon a mixture of traditions of the
earliest seafaring and of the course of certain physical phenomena. So far as the
tradition of primitive seafaring is concerned, it may refer to some half-piratical
expedition, the rich spoils of which might readily be known as the <b>Golden Fleece</b>.
So far as the physical tradition is concerned, it may refer to the course of the
year (the <b>Ram</b> of the Golden Fleece being the fructifying clouds that come and
go across the &AElig;gean) or to the process of sunrise and sunset (?): <b>Helle</b> being the
glimmering twilight that sinks into the sea; <b>Phrixus</b> (in Greek <i>Phrixos</i>), the radiant
sunlight; the voyage of the Argo through the Symplegades, the nocturnal journey
of the sun down the west; the oak with the Golden Fleece, a symbol of the sunset
which the dragon of darkness guards; the fire-breathing bulls, the advent of
morning; the offspring of the dragon's teeth, an image of the sunbeams leaping
from eastern darkness. <b>Medea</b> is a typical wise-woman or witch; daughter of
Hecate and granddaughter of Asteria, the starry heavens, she comes of a family
skilled in magic. Her aunt Circe was even more powerful in necromancy than she.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
The robe of Medea is the fleece in another form. The death of <b>Cre&uuml;sa</b>, also called
Glauce, suggests that of Hercules (in the flaming sunset?). <b>Jason</b> is no more faithful
to his sweetheart than other solar heroes&mdash;Hercules, Perseus, Apollo&mdash;are to
theirs. The sun must leave the colors and glories, the twilights and the clouds of
to-day, for those of to-morrow. See Roscher, pp. 530-537. The physical explanation
is more than commonly plausible. But the numerous adventures of the Argonauts
are certainly survivals of various local legends that have been consolidated and
preserved in the artistic form of the myth. Jason, Di&aacute;son, is another Zeus, of the
Ionian race, beloved by Medea, whose name, "the counseling woman," suggests
a goddess. Perhaps Medea was a local Hera-Demeter, degraded to the rank of a
heroine. The <b>Symplegades</b> may be a reminiscence of rolling and clashing icebergs;
the dove incident occurs in numerous ancient stories from that of Noah
down. If Medea be another personification of morning and evening twilight,
then her dragons are rays of sunlight that precede her. More likely they are
part of the usual equipage of a witch, symbolizing wisdom, foreknowledge, swiftness,
violence, and Oriental mystery.</p>

<p><i><b>Interpretative.</b></i> Discrimination between Minos I and Minos II is made in the
text, but is rarely observed. <b>Minos</b>, according to Preller, is the solar king and
hero of Crete; his wife, <b>Pasipha&euml;</b>, is the moon (who was worshiped in Crete
under the form of a cow); and the <b>Minotaur</b> is the lord of the starry heavens
which are his labyrinth. Others make Pasipha&euml;, whose name means <i>shiner upon</i>
<i>all</i>, the bright heaven; and Minos (in accordance with his name, the Man, <i>par</i>
<i>excellence</i>), the thinker and measurer. A lawgiver on earth, the Homeric Minos
readily becomes a judge in Hades. Various fanciful interpretations, such as
storm cloud, sun, etc., are given of the bull. Cox explains the Minotaur as night,
devouring all things. The tribute from Athens may suggest some early suzerainty
in politics and religion exercised by Crete over neighboring lands. For <b>M&aelig;ander</b>,
see Pope, Rape of the Lock, 5, 65; Dunciad, 1, 64; 3, 55.</p>

<p><b>173. <i>Interpretative.</i> D&aelig;dalus</b> is a representative of the earliest technical skill,
especially in wood-cutting, carving, and the plastic arts used for industrial purposes.
His flight from one land to another signifies the introduction of inventions
into the countries concerned. The fall of Icarus was probably invented to explain
the name of the <b>Icarian</b> Sea.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">+&mdash; <b>Philomela</b></span><br />

<b>Cecrops</b> (see <b>65</b>). According to one tradition, Cecrops was autochthonous and<br />
had one son, Erysichthon, who died without issue, and three daughters, Herse,<br />
Aglauros, and Pandrosos (personifications of Dew and its vivifying influences).<br />
According to another, he was of the line of Erichthonius, being either a son of<br />
Pandion I, or a son of Erechtheus and a grandson of Pandion I. Apollodorus makes<br />
him father of Pandion II. He was regarded as founder of the worship of Athene<br />
and of various civic institutions. He is probably a hero of the Pelasgian race.<br />
<br />
<b>Ion.</b> According to one tradition, the race of Erechtheus became extinct, save<br />
for Ion, a son of Apollo and Cre&uuml;sa, daughter of Erechtheus. This son, having<br />
been removed at birth, was brought up in Apollo's temple at Delphi, and, in<br />
accordance with the oracle of Apollo, afterwards adopted by Cre&uuml;sa and her husband<br />
Xuthus (see the Ion of Euripides). Ion founded the new dynasty of Athens.<br />
But, according to Pausanias and Apollodorus, the dynasty of Erechtheus was continued<br />
by <b>&AElig;geus</b>, who was either a son, or an adopted son, of Pandion II. By<br />
&AElig;thra he became father of Theseus, in whose veins flowed, therefore, the blood<br />
of Pelops and of Erichthonius.<br />
<br />
<i><b>Interpretative.</b></i> The story of <b>Philomela</b> was probably invented to account for<br />
the sad song of the nightingale. With her the swallow is associated as another<br />
much loved bird of spring. Occasionally Procne is spoken of as the nightingale, and<br />
Philomela as the swallow, and Tereus as taking the form of a red-crested hoopoe.<br />

<br />
<b>176-181. Tr&oelig;zen</b>: in Argolis. According to some the Amazonian wife of<br />
Theseus was <b>Hippolyta</b>, but her Hercules had already killed. <b>Theseus</b> is said to<br />
have united the several tribes of Attica into one state, of which Athens was the<br />
capital. In commemoration of this important event, he instituted the festival of<br />
<b>Panathen&aelig;a</b>, in honor of Athene, the patron deity of Athens. This festival differed<br />
from the other Grecian games chiefly in two particulars. It was peculiar to<br />
the Athenians, and its chief feature was a solemn procession in which the Peplus,<br />
or sacred robe of Athene, was carried to the Parthenon, and left on or before<br />
the statue of the goddess. The Peplus was covered with embroidery, worked by<br />
select virgins of the noblest families in Athens. The procession consisted of persons<br />
of all ages and both sexes. The old men carried olive branches in their<br />
hands, and the young men bore arms. The young women carried baskets on their<br />
heads, containing the sacred utensils, cakes, and all things necessary for the sacrifices.<br />
The procession formed the subject of the bas-reliefs which embellished the<br />
frieze of the temple of the Parthenon. A considerable portion of these sculptures<br />
is now in the British Museum among those known as the "Elgin Marbles." We<br />
may mention here the other celebrated national games of the Greeks. The first<br />
and most distinguished were the <b>Olympic</b>, founded, it was said, by Zeus himself.<br />
They were celebrated at Olympia in Elis. Vast numbers of spectators<br />
flocked to them from every part of Greece, and from Asia, Africa, and Sicily.<br />
They were repeated every fifth year in midsummer, and continued five days. They<br />
gave rise to the custom of reckoning time and dating events by Olympiads. The<br />
first Olympiad is generally considered as beginning with the year 776 B.C. The<br />
<b>Pythian</b> games were celebrated in the vicinity of Delphi, the <b>Isthmian</b> on<br />
the Corinthian isthmus, the <b>Nemean</b> at Nemea, a city of Argolis. The exercises<br />
in these games were chariot-racing, running, leaping, wrestling, throwing<br />
the quoit, hurling the javelin, and boxing. Besides these exercises of bodily<br />
strength and agility, there were contests in music, poetry, and eloquence. Thus<br />
these games furnished poets, musicians, and authors the best opportunities to<br />
present their productions to the public, and the fame of the victors was diffused<br />
far and wide.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Interpretative.</i> Theseus</b> is the Attic counterpart of Hercules, not so significant<br />
in moral character, but eminent for numerous similar labors, and pre&euml;minent as<br />
the mythical statesman of Athens. His story may, with the usual perilous facility,<br />
be explained as a solar myth. <b>Periphetes</b> may be a storm cloud with its thunderbolts;<br />
the <b>Marathonian Bull</b> and the <b>Minotaur</b> may be forms of the power of<br />
darkness hidden in the starry labyrinth of heaven. Like Hercules, Theseus fights<br />
with the <b>Amazons</b> (clouds, we may suppose, in some form or other), and, like him,<br />
he descends to the underworld. <b>Ariadne</b> may be another twilight-sweetheart of<br />
the sun, and, like Medea and Dejanira, she must be deserted. She is either the<br />
"well-pleasing" or the "saintly." She was, presumably, a local nature-goddess of<br />
Naxos and Crete, who, in process of time, like Medea, sank to the condition of a<br />
heroine. Probably from her goddess-existence the marriage with Bacchus survived,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>to be incorporated later with the Attic myth of Theseus. As the female<br />
semblance of Bacchus, she appears to have been a promoter of vegetation; and,<br />
like Proserpina, she alternated between the joy of spring and the melancholy of<br />
winter. By some she is considered to be connected with star-worship as a<br />
moon-goddess.<br />

<p>Of the stories told in these and the following sections no systematic, allegorical,
or physical interpretations are here given, because (1) the general method
followed by the unravelers of myth has already been sufficiently illustrated; (2)
the attempt to force symbolic conceptions into the longer folk-stories, or into the
artistic myths and epics of any country, is historically unwarranted and, in
practice, is only too often capricious; (3) the effort to interpret such stories as
the Iliad and the Odyssey must result in destroying those elements of unconscious
simplicity and romantic vigor that characterize the early products of the
creative imagination.</p>

Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, which is based upon the Filostrato and the
Filocolo of Boccaccio. <b>Pandarus</b>: the character of this name, uncle of Cressida,
to be found in Lydgate, Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, and Shakespeare's play
of the same title, enjoys an unsavory reputation for which medieval romance is
responsible. On <b>Menela&uuml;s</b>, see notes to Helen and Agamemnon.</p>

<p><b>Calypso</b>: Pope, Moral Essays, 2, 45; poem by Edgar Fawcett (<i>Putnam's Mag.</i>,
14, 1869). F&eacute;nelon, in his romance of Telemachus, has given us the adventures
of the son of Ulysses in search of his father. Among other places which he visited,
following on his father's footsteps, was Calypso's isle; as in the former case, the
goddess tried every art to keep the youth with her, and offered to share her immortality
with him. But Minerva, who, in the shape of Mentor, accompanied him and
governed all his movements, made him repel her allurements. Finally, when no
other means of escape could be found, the two friends leaped from a cliff into the
sea and swam to a vessel which lay becalmed offshore. Byron alludes to this leap
of Telemachus and Mentor in the stanza of Childe Harold beginning "But not in
silence pass Calypso's isles" (2, 29). Calypso's isle is said to be Goza.</p>

<p>Homer's description of the ships of the Ph&aelig;acians has been thought to look
like an anticipation of the wonders of modern steam navigation. See the address
of Alcino&uuml;s to Ulysses, promising "wondrous ships, self-moved, instinct with
mind," etc. (Odyssey, 8).</p>

<p>Lord Carlisle, in his Diary in the Turkish and Greek Waters, thus speaks of
Corfu, which he considers to be the ancient Ph&aelig;acian island:</p>

<p>"The sites explain the Odyssey. The temple of the sea-god could not have
been more fitly placed, upon a grassy platform of the most elastic turf, on the
brow of a crag commanding harbor, and channel, and ocean. Just at the entrance
of the inner harbor there is a picturesque rock with a small convent perched upon
it, which by one legend is the transformed pinnace of Ulysses.</p>

<p>"Almost the only river in the island is just at the proper distance from the
probable site of the city and palace of the king, to justify the princess Nausicaa
having had resort to her chariot and to luncheon when she went with the maidens
of the court to wash their garments."</p>

<p>The <b>Sibyl</b>. The following legend of the Sibyl is fixed at a later date. In the
reign of one of the Tarquins there appeared before the king a woman who offered
him nine books for sale. The king refused to purchase them, whereupon the
woman went away and burned three of the books, and returning offered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
remaining books for the same price she had asked for the nine. The king again
rejected them; but when the woman, after burning three books more, returned
and asked for the three remaining the same price which she had before asked for
the nine, his curiosity was excited, and he purchased the books. They were found
to contain the destinies of the Roman state. They were kept in the temple of
Jupiter Capitolinus, preserved in a stone chest, and allowed to be inspected only
by especial officers appointed for that duty, who on great occasions consulted
them and interpreted their oracles to the people.</p>

<p>There were various Sibyls; but the Cum&aelig;an Sibyl, of whom Ovid and Virgil

<p><b>The teachings of Anchises</b> to &AElig;neas, respecting the nature of the human
soul, were in conformity with the doctrines of the Pythagoreans. Pythagoras
(born about 540 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) was a native of the island of Samos, but passed the chief
portion of his life at Crotona in Italy. He is therefore sometimes called "the
Samian," and sometimes "the philosopher of Crotona." When young he traveled
extensively and is said to have visited Egypt, where he was instructed by the
priests, and afterwards to have journeyed to the East, where he visited the Persian
and Chaldean Magi, and the Brahmins of India. He established himself at
Crotona, and enjoined sobriety, temperance, simplicity, and silence upon his
throngs of disciples. <i>Ipse dixit</i> (Pythagoras said so) was to be held by them as
sufficient proof of anything. Only advanced pupils might question. Pythagoras
considered <i>numbers</i> as the essence and principle of all things, and attributed to
them a real and distinct existence; so that, in his view, they were the elements
out of which the universe was constructed.</p>

<p>As the numbers proceed from the monad or unit, so he regarded the pure and
simple essence of the Deity as the source of all the forms of nature. Gods,
demons, and heroes are emanations of the Supreme, and there is a fourth
emanation, the human soul. This is immortal, and when freed from the fetters of
the body, passes to the habitation of the dead, where it remains till it returns to
the world, to dwell in some other human or animal body; at last, when sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
purified, it returns to the source from which it proceeded. This doctrine of the
transmigration of souls (metempsychosis), which was originally Egyptian and connected
with the doctrine of reward and punishment of human actions, was the
chief reason why the Pythagoreans killed no animals. Ovid represents Pythagoras
saying that in the time of the Trojan War he was Euphorbus, the son of Panthus,
and fell by the spear of Menela&uuml;s. Lately, he said, he had recognized his shield
hanging among the trophies in the Temple of Juno at Argos.</p>

<p>On <b>Metempsychosis</b>, see the essay in the Spectator (No. 343) on the Transmigration
of Souls; Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice (Gratiano to Shylock).</p>

<p><b>Harmony of the Spheres.</b> The relation of the notes of the musical scale to
numbers, whereby harmony results from proportional vibrations of sound, and
discord from the reverse, led Pythagoras to apply the word <i>harmony</i> to the
visible creation, meaning by it the just adaptation of parts to each other. This is
the idea which Dryden expresses in the beginning of his song for St. Cecilia's
Day, "From harmony, from heavenly harmony, This everlasting frame began."</p>

<p>In the center of the universe (as Pythagoras taught) there was a central fire,
the principle of life. The central fire was surrounded by the earth, the moon, the
sun, and the five planets. The distances of the various heavenly bodies from one
another were conceived to correspond to the proportions of the musical scale.
See Merchant of Venice, Act V (Lorenzo and Jessica), for the Music of the
Spheres; also Milton, Hymn on the Nativity. See Longfellow's Verses to a
Child, and Occultation of Orion, for Pythagoras as inventor of the lyre.</p>

<p><b>260. Camilla.</b> Pope, illustrating the rule that "the sound should be an echo
to the sense," says:</p>

W. M. W. Call, Balder; and Thor. Sydney Dobell's Balder does not rehearse the
Norse myth. It is a poem dealing with the spiritual maladies of the time, excellent
in parts, but confused and uneven. Longfellow's Saga of King Olaf (the Musician's
Tale, Wayside Inn) is from the Heimskri&#x1E45;gla, or Book of Stories of the
Kings, edited by Snorri Sturlason. Many of the cantos of the Saga throw light
on Norse mythology. See also the Hon. Roden No&euml;l's Ragnarok (in the Modern
Faust), for an ethical modification of the ancient theme.</p>

<p><b>Anses</b> (the Asa-folk, &AElig;sir, etc.). The word probably means <i>ghost</i>, <i>ancestral</i>
<i>spirit</i>,&mdash;of such kind as the Manes of the Romans. The derivation may be from
the root <i>AN</i>, 'to breathe,' whence <i>animus</i> (Vigfusson and Powell, Corp. Poet. Bor.
1, 515). According to Jordanes, the Anses were demigods, ancestors of royal
races. The main cult of the older religion was ancestor-worship, Thor and Woden
being worshiped by a tribe, but each family having its own <i>anses</i>, or deified ancestors
(Corp. Poet. Bor. 2, 413). <b>Elf</b> was another name used of spirits of the dead.
Later it sinks to the significance of "fairy." Indeed, say Vigfusson and Powell,
half our ideas about fairies are derived from the heathen beliefs as to the spirits
of the dead, their purity, kindliness, homes in hillocks (cf. the Irish "folk of the
hills," <i>Banshees</i>, etc.) (Corp. Poet. Bor. 2, 418).</p>

<p>The <b>Norse Religion</b> consists evidently of two distinct strata: the lower, of
gods, that are personifications of natural forces, or deified heroes, with regular
sacrifices, with belief in ghosts, etc.; the upper, of doctrines introduced by
Christianity. To the latter belong the Last Battle to be fought by Warrior-Angels
and the Elect against the Beast, the Dragon, and the Demons of Fire (Corp.
Poet. Bor. 2, 459).</p>

<p><b>Odin</b> or <b>Woden</b> was first the god of the heaven, or heaven itself, then husband
of earth, god of war and of wisdom, lord of the ravens, lord of the gallows (which
was called Woden's tree or Woden's steed). <b>Frigga</b> is Mother Earth. <b>Thor</b> is the
lord of the hammer&mdash;the thunderbolt, the adversary of giants and all oppressors
of man. He is dear to man, always connected with earth,&mdash;the husband of <i>Sif</i>
(the Norse Ceres). His goat-drawn car makes the rumbling of the thunder. <b>Freyr</b>
means <i>lord</i>; patron of the Swedes, harvest-god. <b>Balder</b> means also <i>lord</i> or <i>king</i>.
On the one hand, his attributes recall those of Apollo; on the other hand, his story
appeals to, and is colored by, the Christian imagination. He is another figure of
that radiant type to which belong all bright and genial heroes, righters of wrong,
blazing to consume evil, gentle and strong to uplift weakness: Apollo, Hercules,
Perseus, Achilles, Sigurd, St. George, and many another. <b>H&ouml;der</b> is the "adversary."</p>

<p><b>Nanna</b>, Balder's wife, is the ensample of constancy; her name is <i>maiden</i>.</p>

<p><b>282.</b> The <b>Volsunga Saga</b>. The songs of the Elder Edda, from which Eirikr
Magn&uacute;sson and William Morris draw their Story of the Volsungs and the Nibelungs
(London, 1870), are The Lay of Helgi the Hunding's-Bane, The Lay of
Sigrdrifa, The Short Lay of Sigurd, The Hell-Ride of Brynhild, The Lay of
Brynhild, The Ancient Lay of Gudrun, The Song of Atli, The Whetting of Gudrun,
The Lay of Hamdir, The Lament of Oddrun. For translations of these fragments,
see pp. 167-270 of the volume mentioned above. For the originals and literal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
translations of these and other Norse lays of importance, see Vigfusson and
Powell's Corpus Poeticum Boreale; and Vigfusson's Sturlunga Saga, 2 vols. For
the story of Sigurd, read William Morris' spirited epic, Sigurd the Volsung.
Illustrative of the Norse spirit are Motherwell's Battle-Flag of Sigurd, the Wooing
Song of Jarl Egill Skallagrim, and the Sword Chant of Thorstein Raudi; also
Dora Greenwell's Battle-Flag of Sigurd; and Charles Kingsley's Longbeard's
Saga, in Hypatia. Baldwin's Story of Siegfried (New York, 1888) is a good introduction
for young people.</p>

<p><b>283.</b> The <b>Nibelungenlied</b>. The little book entitled Echoes from Mist Land,
by Auber Forestier (Chicago, Griggs &amp; Co., 1877) will be of value to the beginner.
Other translations are made by A. G. Foster-Barham (London, 1887) and by W. N.
Lettsom, The Fall of the Nibelungers (London, 1874), both in verse. See also
T. Carlyle, Nibelungenlied (Crit. Miscell.), Essays, 2, 220. Modern German
editions by Simrock, Bartsch, Marbach, and Gerlach are procurable. The edition
by Werner Hahn (Uebersetzung d. Handschrift A, Collection Spemann, Berlin u.
Stuttgart) has been used in the preparation of this account. The original was
published in part by Bodmer in 1757; later, in full by C. H. Myller, by K. K.
Lachmann (Nibelunge N&ocirc;t mit der Klage, 1826); by K. F. Bartsch (Der Nibelunge
N&ocirc;t, 2 vols. in 3, 1870-1880), and in Pfeiffer's Deutsch. Classik. des Mittelalt., Vol. 3,
(1872); and by others (see James Sime's <i>Nibelungenlied</i>, Encyc. Brit.). Of some
effect in stimulating interest were Dr. W. Jordan's Studies and Recitations of the
Nibelunge, which comprised the Siegfried Saga, and Hildebrandt's Return.
Especially of value is Richard Wagner's series of operas, The Ring of the Nibelung,
<b>284-288</b>. In painting, Schnorr von Carolsfeld's wall pictures illustrative of
the Nibelungenlied, in the royal palace at Munich, are well known; also the
illustrations of the four operas by J. Hoffmann, and by Th. Pixis.</p>

<p><b>282-283.</b> Historically, <b>Siegfried</b> has been identified, variously, with (1) the
great German warrior Arminius (or Hermann), the son of Sigimer, chief of the
tribe of the Cherusci, who inhabited the southern part of what is now Hanover
and Brunswick. Born 18 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> and trained in the Roman army, in the year 9 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
he overcame with fearful slaughter the Roman tyrants of Germany, defeating the
Roman commander Varus and his legions in the Teutoburg Forest in the valley
of the Lippe; (2) Sigibert, king of the Ripuarian Franks, who in 508 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> was
treacherously slain while taking a midday nap in the forest; (3) Sigibert, king
of the Austrasian Franks whose history recalls more than one event of the Sigurd
and Siegfried stories; for he discovered a treasure, fought with and overcame
foreign nations,&mdash;the Huns, the Saxons, the Danes,&mdash;and finally in consequence
of a quarrel between his wife Br&uuml;nhilde and his sister-in-law Fredegunde, was, in
576 <span class="smcap">A.D.,</span> assassinated by the retainers of the latter; (4) Julius, or Claudius Civilis,
the leader of the Batavi in the revolt against Rome, 69-70 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> It is probable
that in Sigurd and Siegfried we have recollections combined of two or more of
these historic characters.</p>

<p>Mythologically, <b>Sigurd</b> (of the shining eyes that no man might face unabashed)
has been regarded as a reflection of the god Balder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Gunnar</b> and <b>Gunther</b> are, historically, recognized in a slightly known king of
the Burgundians, Gundicar, who with his people was overwhelmed by the Huns
in 437 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p><b>Atli</b> and <b>Etzel</b> are poetic idealizations of the renowned Hunnish chieftain,
Attila, who united under his rule the German and Slavonic nations, ravaged the
Eastern Roman Empire between 445 and 450 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, and, invading the Western
Empire, was defeated by the Romans in the great battle of Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne,
451. He died 454 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p><b>Dietrich of Berne</b> (Verona) bears some very slight resemblance to Theodoric,
the Ostrogoth, who, between 493 and 526 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, ruled from Italy what had been
the Western Empire. In these poems, however, his earlier illustrious career is
overlooked; he is merely a refugee in the court of the Hunnish king, and, even
so, is confounded with uncles of his who had been retainers of Attila; for the
historic Theodoric was not born until two years after the historic Attila's death.</p>

<p>These historic figures were, of course, merely suggestions for, or contributions
to, the great heroes of the epics, not prototypes; the same is true of any apparently
confirmed historic forerunners of Brynhild, or Gudrun, or Kriemhild. The
mythological connection of these epics with the Norse myths of the seasons,
Sigurd being Balder of the spring, and Hogni H&ouml;der of winter and darkness, is
ingenious; but, except as reminding us of the mythic material which the bards
were likely to recall and utilize, it is not of substantial worth.</p>

<p>In the Norse version, the name <b>Nibelung</b> is interchangeable with the patronymic
<b>Giuking</b>,&mdash;it is the name of the family that ruins Sigurd. But, in the German
version, the name is of purely mythical import: the Nibelungs are not a human
race; none but Siegfried may have intercourse with them. The land of the Nibelungs
is equally vague in the German poem; it is at one time an island, again a
mountain, and in one manuscript it is confounded with Norway. But mythically
it is connected with Niflheim, the kingdom of Hela, the shadowy realm of death.
The earth, that gathers to her bosom the dead, cherishes also in her bosom the
hoard of gold. Naturally, therefore, the hoard is guarded by Alberich, the dwarf,
for dwarfs have always preferred the underworld. So (according to Werner
Hahn, and others) there is a deep mythical meaning in the Lay of the Nibelungs:
beings that dwell far from the light of day; or that, possessing the riches of
mortality, march toward the land of death.</p>

<p><b>284-288.</b> Wagner finished this series of operas in 1876. For a translation
the reader is referred to the four librettos, Englished by Frederick Jameson
(Schott &amp; Co., London); or to the series published by Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; Co.,
New York.</p>

<p><b>298. Homer</b> is also called Melesigenes, son of Meles&mdash;the stream on which
Smyrna was built. The Homerid&aelig;, who lived on Chios, claimed to be descended
from Homer. They devoted themselves to the cultivation of epic poetry.</p>

<p><b>Other Greek Poets of Mythology</b> to be noted are <b>Callimachus</b> (260 <span class="smcap">B.C</span>.),
whose Lock of Berenice is reproduced in the elegiacs of Catullus, and from whose
Origins (of sacred rites) Ovid drew much of his information. Also <b>Nicander</b>
(150 <span class="smcap">B.C</span>.), whose Transformations, and <b>Parthenius</b>, whose Metamorphoses furnished
material to the Latin poet. With Theocritus should be read <b>Bion</b> and
<b>Moschus</b>, all three masters of the idyl and elegy. See Andrew Lang's translation
of Theocritus, Bion, and Moschus; and the verses by Dobson and Gosse
with which Lang prefaces the translation. <b>Lycophron</b> (260 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) wrote a poem
called Alexandra, on the consequences of the voyage of Paris to Sparta. The
Loves of Hero and Leander were probably written by a grammarian, <b>Mus&aelig;us</b>,
as late as 500 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span></p>

<p><b>Translations of Greek Poets.</b> The best verse translations of Homer are those
of Chapman, Pope, the Earl of Derby, Cowper, and Worsley.</p>

<p>An excellent prose translation of the Iliad is that of Lang, Leaf, and Myers
(London, Macmillan &amp; Co., 1889); of the Odyssey, that by Butcher and Lang

<p><b>299. Roman Poets. Horace</b> (65 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>) in his Odes, Epodes, and Satires makes
frequent reference and allusion to the common stock of mythology, sometimes
telling a whole story, as that of the daughters of Dana&uuml;s. <b>Catullus</b> (87 B.C.), the
most original of Roman love-poets, gives us the Nuptials of Peleus and Thetis
(for selections in English hexameters, see <b>177</b> and <b>191</b>), the Lock of Berenice,
and the Atys. <b>Manilius</b> of the age of Augustus wrote a poem on Astronomy,
which contains a philosophic statement of star-myths. <b>Valerius Flaccus</b> (d. 88 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>)
based his Argonautics upon the poem of that name by Apollonius of Rhodes.
<b>Statius</b> (61 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>) revived in the brilliant verses of his Thebaid and his Achille&iuml;d
the epic myths and epic machinery, but not the vigor and naturalness of the
ancient style. To a prose writer, <b>Hyginus</b>, who lived on terms of close intimacy
with Ovid, a fragmentary work called the Book of Fables, which is sometimes a
useful source of information, and four books of Poetical Astronomy, have been
attributed. The works, as we have them, could not have been written by a friend
of the cultivated Ovid.</p>

<p><b>Runes</b> were "the letters of the alphabets used by all the old Teutonic tribes....
The letters were even considered magical, and cast into the air written
separately upon chips or spills of wood, to fall, as fate determined, on a cloth,
and then be read by the interpreters.... The association of the runic letters
with heathen mysteries and superstition caused the first Christian teachers to
discourage, and, indeed, as far as possible, suppress their use. They were therefore
superseded by the Latin alphabet, which in First English was supplemented
by retention of two of the runes, named 'thorn' and 'wen,' to represent sounds
of 'th' and 'w,' for which the Latin alphabet had no letters provided. Each rune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
was named after some object whose name began with the sound represented.
The first letter was F, Feoh, money; the second U, Ur, a bull; the third Th,
Thorn, a thorn; the fourth O, Os, the mouth; the fifth R, Rad, a saddle; the sixth
C, Cen, a torch; and the six sounds being joined together make Futhorc, which

<h2><a name="A_FEW_RULES_FOR_THE_ENGLISH_PRONUNCIATION" id="A_FEW_RULES_FOR_THE_ENGLISH_PRONUNCIATION">A FEW RULES FOR THE ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION
OF GREEK AND LATIN PROPER NAMES</a></h2>

<p>[These rules will cover most cases, but they are not intended to exhaust the subject. The reader is
referred to the Latin grammars and the English dictionaries.]</p>


<p>I. <i>Quantity.</i> The reader must first ascertain whether the second last syllable
of the word is long. In general a syllable is long in quantity:</p>

<p>(1) If it contains a diphthong, or a long vowel: <i>Bau</i>-cis, Ac-<i>tae</i>-on, <i>M&#x0113;</i>-tis,
O-<i>r&#x012B;</i>-on, <i>Fl&#x014D;</i>-ra.</p>

<p>(2) If its vowel, whether long or short, is followed by <i>j</i>, <i>x</i>, or <i>z</i>, or by any two
consonants except a mute and a liquid: <i>A&acute;</i>-jax, Meg-a-<i>ba&acute;</i>-zus, A-<i>dras&acute;</i>-tus.</p>

<p><i>Note (a).</i> Sometimes two vowels come together without forming a diphthong.
In such cases the di&aelig;resis is, in this volume, used to indicate the division:
<i>e.g.</i> Men-e-l&#x0101;'-<i>&uuml;s</i>, Pe-n&#x0113;'-<i>&uuml;s</i>.</p>

<p><i>Note (b).</i> The <i>syllable</i> formed by a short vowel before a mute with <i>l</i> or <i>r</i> is
sometimes long and sometimes short: <i>e.g.</i> Cle-o-<i>p&#x0101;'</i>-tra, or Cle-op&acute;-<i>&#x0103;</i>-tra; Pa-<i>tr&#x014D;'</i>-clus,
or Pat&acute;-<i>r&#x014F;</i>-clus.</p>


<p>II. <i>Accent.</i></p>

<p>(1) The accent may be principal, or subordinate: Hel<sup>2</sup>-les-pon&acute;-tus.</p>

<p>(2) <b>The principal accent falls on the second last syllable (<i>penult</i>): Am-phi-tri&acute;-te;
or on the third last syllable (<i>antepenult</i>): Am-phit&acute;-ry-on.</b></p>

<p><i>Note (a)</i> In words of two syllables, it falls on the <i>penult</i>: Cir&acute;-ce.</p>

<p><i>Note (b)</i> <b>In words of more than two syllables, it falls on the <i>penult</i> when
that syllable is long; otherwise, on the <i>antepenult</i>: &AElig;-n&#x0113;'-as, Her&acute;-c&#x016D;-les.</b></p>

<p>(3) The subordinate accent:</p>

<p><i>Note (a)</i> If only two syllables precede the principal accent, the subordinate
accent falls on the first syllable of the word: <i>Hip<sup>2</sup>-po</i>-cr&#x0113;'ne.</p>

<p><i>Note (b)</i> If more than two syllables precede the principal accent, the laws governing
the principal accent apply to those preceding syllables: <i>Cas<sup>2</sup>-s&#x012D;-o</i>-p&#x0113;'-a.</p>

<p><b><i>Note.</i> In the Index of this work, when the <i>penult</i> of a word is long, it is
marked with the accent; when the penult is short, the <i>antepenult</i> is marked.</b>
The reader should however bear in mind that a <i>syllable</i> may be long even though
it contain a short vowel, as by Rule I, (2), above.</p>


<p>III. <i>Vowels and Consonants.</i> These rules depend upon those of Syllabication:</p>

<p>(1) A vowel generally has its <i>long</i> English sound when it ends a syllable:
<i>He&acute;-ro</i>, <i>I&acute;-o</i>, <i>Ca&acute;-cus</i>, <i>I-tho&acute;-me</i>, <i>E-do&acute;-ni</i>, <i>My-ce&acute;-n&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) A vowel generally has its <i>short</i> English sound in a syllable that ends in a
consonant: <i>Hel&acute;-en</i>, <i>Sis&acute;</i>-y-<i>phus</i>, <i>Pol</i>-y-phe&acute;-<i>mus</i>. But <i>e</i> in the termination <i>es</i> has
its long sound: Her&acute;<i>mes</i>, A-tri&acute;-<i>des</i>.</p>

<p>(3) The vowel <i>a</i> has an <i>obscure</i> sound when it ends an unaccented syllable:
A-ch&aelig;&acute;-<i>a</i>; so, also, the vowel <i>i</i> or <i>y</i>, not final, after an accented syllable: Hes-per&acute;-<i>i</i>-des;
and sometimes <i>i</i> or <i>y</i> in an unaccented first syllable: <i>Ci</i>-lic&acute;-i-a.</p>

<p>(4) Consonants have their usual English sounds; but <i>c</i> and <i>g</i> are soft before <i>e</i>,
<i>i</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>&aelig;</i>, and <i>&oelig;</i>: <i>Ce&acute;</i>-to, <i>Ge&acute;</i>-ry-on, <i>Gy&acute;-ges</i>; <i>ch</i> has the sound of <i>k</i>: <i>Chi&acute;</i>-os; and <i>c</i>,
<i>s</i>, and <i>t</i>, immediately preceded by the accent and standing before <i>i</i> followed by
another vowel, commonly have the sound of <i>sh</i>: <i>Sic&acute;</i>-y-on (but see Latin grammars
and English dictionaries for exceptions).</p>


<p>IV. <i>Syllabication.</i></p>

<p>(1) The penultimate syllable ends with a vowel: <i>e.g.</i> Pe-<i>ne&acute;</i>-us, I-<i>tho&acute;</i>-me,
<i>A&acute;</i>-treus, Hel&acute;-<i>e</i>-nus;</p>

<p><i>Except when</i> its vowel is followed by <i>x</i> or by two consonants (not a mute with
<i>l</i> or <i>r</i>), then the vowel is joined with the succeeding consonant: <i>Nax</i>-os, <i>Cir</i>-ce,
Aga-<i>mem</i>-non.</p>

<p>(2) Other syllables (not ultimate or penultimate) end with a vowel: <i>e.g.</i> <i>Pi</i>-r&aelig;-us;</p>

<p><i>Except when (a)</i> the vowel is followed by <i>x</i> or any two consonants (not a mute
with <i>l</i> or <i>r</i>): <i>e.g.</i> <i>Ix</i>-i&acute;-on, Pel-o-<i>pon</i>-ne&acute;-sus; <i>and when (b)</i> the syllable is accented
and its vowel followed by one or more consonants: <i>e.g.</i> <i>An</i><sup>2</sup>-ax-<i>ag&acute;</i>-o-ras, Am-<i>phic&acute;</i>ty-on,
&OElig;d-'i-pus.</p>

<p><i>Note (a).</i> But an accented <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, or <i>o</i> before a single consonant (or a mute with
<i>l</i> or <i>r</i>), followed by <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, or <i>y</i> before another vowel, is not joined with the succeeding
consonant, and consequently has the long sound: Pau-<i>s&#x0101;'</i>-ni-as; De-<i>m&#x0113;'</i>-tri-us.</p>

<p><i>Note (b).</i> An accented <i>u</i> before a single consonant (or mute with <i>l</i> or <i>r</i>) is not
joined with the succeeding consonant, and consequently has the long sound:
<i>J&#x016B;'</i>-pi-ter.</p>

<p>(3) <b>All words have as many syllables as they have vowels and diphthongs.</b></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>Buddha (b&#x014F;&#x014F;d&acute;&#x1EBD;). Family name, Gautama; given names, Siddartha ("in whom wishes are fulfilled") and Buddha ("he who knows"). Born 628 B.C., son of the king of Kapilavastu, north of Oude, India; died in his eighty-fifth year. Founder of Buddhism, which, in opposition to the dead creed and forms of Brahmanism, taught: "(1) Existence is only pain or sorrow. (2) The cause of pain or sorrow is desire. (3) In Nirvana all pain and sorrow cease. (4) Nirvana is attainable by the 'noble path&acute; of virtuous self-discipline." <i>Nirvana</i> is both a means and an end. As a means, it is the process of renunciation by which the love of life and self are extinguished; as an end, it is the heaven of the Buddhist, a negative bliss consisting in absorption of the soul into the Infinite. The soul is the <i>Karma</i>, the sum total of a man's deeds, good and evil,&mdash;his character, by which is determined his state of future existence. The Karma passes through various earthly existences in the process of renunciation described above.<br />

Egyptian divinities, (1) Those of Memphis were Phtha, Ra, Shu and Tefnet, Seb and Nut, Osiris and Isis, Seth and Nephthys, Horus and Hathor.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(2) Those of Thebes were Amen (Ammon), Mentu, Atmu, Shu and Tefnet, Seb and Nut, Osiris and Isis, Seth and Nephthys, Horus and Hathor, Sebek, Tennet, and Penit.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">See <i>Encyc. Brit.</i>, and authorities referred to in <i>C. 302</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The following lists are genealogically arranged:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(1) Phtha, Seb, Ra;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">(2) Amen, etc.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(1) <i>Phtha</i> or <i>Ptah</i>: chief deity of Memphis; perhaps of foreign origin. His name means the "opener," or the "carver." He is called "the Father of the Beginning," and as the prime architect, or artificer, recalls the Greek Heph&aelig;stus. He is the activity of the "Spirit," Neph, Chnuphis. He is represented as a mummy or a pygmy.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Pakht</i> and <i>Bast</i>: a goddess of two forms, lioness-headed or cat-headed. At Memphis, Pakht was worshiped as wife of Phtha; at Bubastis, Bast was adored as daughter of Isis.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Nefer Atum</i>: worshiped at Heliopolis as the son of Phtha. Like Osiris (see below), he is the sun of the underworld.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Seb</i>: the father of the Osirian gods. He is the god of earth and its vegetation; represented as a man with the head of a goose; he corresponds with the Greek Cronus; his consort was Nut.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Nut</i>: wife of Seb, mother of the Osirian gods; the vault of heaven; she may be likened to the Greek Rhea.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Osi&acute;ris</i>, or <i>Hesiri</i>: the good principle. Identified with the vivifying power of the sun and of the waters of the Nile. In general, the most human and most beneficent of the Egyptian deities. He is the son of Seb (or, according to some, of Neph, Chnuphis). He may be likened to the Greek Apollo, as a representative of spiritual light; to Dionysus in his vivifying function. He wages war with his brother Seth (Set), the principle of Evil, but is vanquished by him, boxed in a chest, drowned, and finally cut into small pieces. His sister-wife, Isis, recovers all but one piece of the body of O., and buries them. He becomes protector of the shades, judge of the underworld, the sun of the night, the tutelary deity of the Egyptians. He is avenged by his son Horus, who, with the aid of Thoth (reason), temporarily overcomes Seth. The myth may refer to the daily struggle of the sun with darkness, and also to the unending strife of good with evil, the course of human life, and of the life after death. O. is represented as a mummy crowned with the Egyptian miter.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>I&acute;sis</i>, or <i>Hes</i>: the wife and feminine counterpart of Osiris. Represented as a woman crowned with the sun's disk or cow's horns, bearing also upon her head her emblem, the throne.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Ho&acute;rus</i>, or <i>Har</i>: son of Osiris and Isis, who, as the strong young sun of the day, avenges his father, the sun of the underworld. He is Horus the child, Horus the elder (as taking the place of his father on earth), or sometimes Horus Harpocrates, the god of silence. As the latter, he holds a finger to his lips. He may be compared with the Greek Apollo.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Harpoc&acute;ra-tes</i>: see <i>Horus</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Ha&acute;thor</i>, or <i>Athor</i>: a goddess often identified with Isis. She had the head of a cow and wears the sun's disk, and plumes. Her name means "Home of Horus." She has characteristics of the Greek Aphrodite.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Seth</i>, or <i>Set</i>: the principle of physical, and later of moral, darkness and evil. He is the opponent of his brother, or father, Osiris. Represented as a monster with ass's body, jackal's ears and snout, and the tail of a lion.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Nephthys</i>: a goddess of the dead; the sister of Isis, and wife of Seth. She aided Isis to recover the drowned Osiris.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>A&acute;pis</i>: the sacred bull, into which the life of Osiris was supposed to have passed. The name also indicates the Nile. The bull Apis must have certain distinguishing marks; he was treated like a god; and on his death (he was drowned at twenty-five years of age) the land went into mourning until his successor was found. He was worshiped with pomp in Memphis.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">See <i>Serapis</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Sera&acute;pis</i> (or <i>Ser&acute;apis</i>; see <i>Milton, Paradise Lost, 1, 720</i>): as Apis represents the living Osiris, so S. the Osiris who had passed into the underworld.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Ra</i>: originally the deity of the physical attributes of the sun; but ultimately the representative of supreme godhead. Worshiped through all Egypt, and associated with other gods who are then manifestations of his various attributes. He is the victorious principle or light, life, and right, but rules over, rather than sympathizes with, mankind. He is of human form, sometimes hawk-headed, always crowned with the sun's disk. His Greek counterpart is not Apollo, but Helios.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Mentu</i>: Ra, as the rising sun</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Atmu</i>: Ra, as the setting sun</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Shu</i>: the solar light; son of Ra, Mentu, or Atmu</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">(2) <i>Ammon</i>, or <i>Amen</i>: "the hidden," a deity of the Egyptian Thebes; generally associated in attributes with some other god. As Amen-Ra he is the king of Theban gods, the divinity of the sun. He is of human form; rarely with a goat's head, as represented by the Greeks. He corresponds to the Greek Zeus. As Amen-Khem he is the god of productivity, and is represented with a flail in his hand. His consort is Mut, or Maut, and their son is Khuns.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Mut</i>, or <i>Maut</i>: the mother; the Theban goddess of womanhood, wife of Amen-Ra. She corresponds to the Greek Demeter.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Khuns</i>: son of Ammon and Maut; a divinity of the moon. He is sometimes hawk-headed; generally invested with the disk and crescent of the moon.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Neph</i>, <i>Chnuphis</i>, <i>Khnum</i>, <i>Num</i>, or <i>Nu</i>: the soul of the universe; the word or will of Ammon-Ra; the creator. Represented with the head of a ram.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Khem, Chem</i> (<i>cf.</i> Milton's <i>Cham</i>), called also <i>Min</i>: the energizing principle of physical life. Associated with both Ammon and Osiris. His counterpart in classical mythology is Pan, or, as god of gardens, Priapus.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Neith</i>: goddess of the upper heaven; self-produced; mother of the sun; goddess, consequently, of wisdom, the arts of peace and of war. Likened by the Greeks to Athena. Worshiped in Lower Egypt as a woman in form, with bow and arrows in her hand.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Ma-t</i>: goddess of truth; her emblem is the ostrich feather, which signifies truth. She is the wife of Thoth.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Thoth</i>: the chief moon-god; characterized by his wisdom, and his patronage of letters. Husband of Ma-t</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Anubis</i>: son of Osiris. Guide of ghosts</span><br />

Hindu divinities: arranged logically as (1) Vedic, (2) Brahmanic. For Buddhism see <i>Buddha</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(1) Vedic: the Aryan, and earliest form of Hindu religion; dealing primarily with elemental powers that, in time, acquired spiritual signification</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Vedas</i>: the Sanskrit scriptures; from root, to know, to be wise; see p. <a href="#Page_462">462</a>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Devas</i>: the shining ones, the gods (Gk. <i>theos</i>, Lat. <i>deus</i>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Dyaus</i>: the shining sky, the elemental overruling spirit of the primitive Aryans (Gk. <i>Zeus</i>, Lat. <i>Jovis</i>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Prithivi</i>: goddess Earth, spouse of Dyaus</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Indra</i>: son of Dyaus and Prithivi; the atmospheric region; chief of the gods, and strongest; wielder of the thunderbolt, lord of the plains, bull of the heavens, conqueror of the malignant, thirsty Vritra, gatherer of clouds, dispenser of rain; adored in heaven and on earth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Varuna</i>: god of the vault of heaven (root <i>var</i>, to cover; Gk. <i>Ouranos</i>, Lat. <i>Uranus</i>); the all-seeing, the pardoner, merciful even to the guilty</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Ushas</i>: the dawn, mother of mornings, brilliant of raiment, golden-colored, spreading far and wide, everywhere awakening men, preparing the pathway of the sun, and leading his white steed (Gk. <i>Eos</i>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Surya</i>: the god who dwells in the sun (Gk. <i>Helios</i>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Savitar</i>: the golden-handed sun in his daily course; the shining wanderer, comforter of men</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Soma</i>: a deification of the spirituous "extract" of the moon-plant; giver of strength to gods and men, and of radiant light and joyous immortality</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Vayu</i>: god of the wind</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Maruts</i>: deities of the storm</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Agni</i>: the youngest and one of the most important of the Vedic gods; lord of fire, born of two pieces of wood rubbed together; youngest of the deities, giver of prosperity to men, their guardian and companion, passing between heaven and earth "like a messenger between two hamlets" (Lat. <i>ignis</i>; <i>cf.</i> Gk. <i>Heph&aelig;stus</i>)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Vach</i>: goddess of speech, teacher of spiritual worship, promoter of wisdom and holiness</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Vritra</i>: the monstrous snake, drinker of rain-clouds, dark, evil, and malicious, overcome by Indra (<i>cf.</i> Apollo and the Python)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Rakshasas</i>: powers of darkness, combated by Indra</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Yama</i>, and his sister <i>Yami</i>: the first man and woman; leaving this life they prepared for those that should follow them blissful abodes in the other world, of which they are king and queen</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">(2) Brahmanic: a philosophical outgrowth of the Vedic religion, which, on the one hand, was refined into logical subtleties, intelligible only to the learned; on the other hand, crystallized into symbols, rites, and unending conventionalities</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Trimurti</i>: the Brahmanic Trinity, consisting of the following three persons:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Brahma</i>: in the Rig-Veda, a word for devotion, prayer; later, for the supreme principle of the universe, its source, its essence, and its sustenance. Brahma is the <i>creative energy</i> of the godhead, calm, passionless, remote from man and the world. He is four-headed and four-handed.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Vishnu</i>: originally a benevolent Vedic deity, with certain attributes of the sun; adopted by a sect as its special god, and then annexed by the Brahmans as a manifestation of the supreme being in his work of <i>preservation</i>. He has nine times assumed human form, each incarnation having for its purpose the redemption of mankind from oppression or error. These incarnations are his <i>Avatars</i>. His ninth <i>Avatar</i>, say some, was as Buddha; in his tenth he will end this world, and reproduce Brahma, who will create things anew.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Siva</i>: originally a bloodthirsty deity, not of the Vedic, but of some aboriginal Hindu religion; absorbed in the Brahmanic godhead as the manifestation of <i>destructive power</i>. He is adorned with a necklace of skulls and earrings of serpents.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Sarasvati</i>: goddess of speech (see <i>Vach</i>); spouse of Brahma</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Sri</i>, or <i>Lakshmi</i>: goddess of beauty; spouse of Vishnu</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Uma</i>, or <i>Parvati</i> (Kali, Durga): the inaccessible, the terrible; spouse of Siva</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Gandharvas</i>: genii of music (<i>cf.</i> Centaurs); retainers of Indra</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Lokapalas</i>: generic name for the Vedic deities when degraded by Brahmanism to the position of tutelary spirits</span><br />
